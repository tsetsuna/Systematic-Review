       "[{'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"The paper describes a protocol-level adaptation mechanism to enhance the performance of network service provisioning to clientele. In our model, a service provider (SP) maintains multiple protocol modules to exercise the infrastructure resources. Here, each protocol exhibits a certain degree of cost optimality (in terms of resource usage) in distinct operating regions of the network infrastructure. An example is the cost tradeoff between the 'goback-N' and 'selective repeat' based retransmission schemes for 'reliable data transfer' between end-points under various packet loss rates in the network. During run-time, the SP selects one of the protocol modules that can meet the client-requested service obligation under the prevailing resource-level operating conditions. Our model allows a 'dynamic switching' from one protocol module to another at run-time based on the changing network conditions. The overall goal is to offer a sustained access to the service with a resource-optimal and QoS-compliant service offering. The paper describes 'protocol switching' as an architectural foundation for building cost-effective network services\",\n",

These can increase productivity and offer an improved lifestyle for users. The data management system-context architecture (DMS-CA) has been designed to provide these services. The DMS-CA is novel in providing a completely generic system that is both user-friendly and efficient. The system is generic in that it can be tailored by the system administrator (using XML specifications) for a particular environment of context information inputs and a set of services. In addition, the actual rules that determine which services are triggered by which combination of contextual inputs are determined by the individual user in a user-friendly manner. Thus the generic architecture can be easily deployed for a particular building and an individual user. Generic solutions are sometimes inefficient but this system has been designed to be highly efficient through using an event-based architecture and dealing with time in a special way. The DMS-CA has been deployed for a building incorporating a wireless sensor network, and shown to provide a high quality, efficient context-sensitive data delivery service.',\n",

Dynamic adaptation is specially important on environments which resources vary over time, and which applications manage requests from users with different preferences (e.g. language). Building such adaptive software requires applications designers to include the necessary adaptation mechanisms. Moreover, when dealing with distributed applications, designers may want to distribute the adaptation mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a model for dynamic adaptation that clearly separates adaptation from business logic and that can be customized by applications designers in order to satisfy adaptation needs. The model is based on a set of mandatory functionalities that manage basic adaptation operations and an optional functionality that can be used to manage adaptation mechanisms distribution. We have used our adaptation model to build an adaptive data consistency service of an ambient assistive living application.',\n",

To tackle problems in fulfillingoccupants' needs while reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, it requires using distributed simulations to investigate the impact of advanced control systems on building performance applications through virtual representations rather than using experimental trials, which are usually time-consuming and cost prohibitive. For this reason, this paper describes the development and implementation of a framework for distributed simulations involving different software tools over a network. The main role of this framework is analogous to a cooperative middleware that distributes one or more building performance simulation tool(s)and control systems environment by run-time coupling over a network as qualified by similarity to Buildings Automation and Control Systems (BACS) architecture. The paper ends by giving an outlook on the future work of further developments, mainly the analysis of emergent properties multi-physical co-simulation.\",\n",

Low-cost IEEE 802.15.4 functioned sensor devices are installed at the motor control centers to collect the motor terminal voltages and currents. These data are then sent through a WSN to the central supervisory station, where energy usage efficiencies and health conditions of the motors are estimated using nonintrusive methods. As a continuation of the authors' pervious work, this paper specifically focuses on the experimental realization and validation of the proposed scheme. A test bed is demonstrated with prototype wireless sensors. Four induction motors with different physical conditions are fully tested and the experimental results are analyzed\",\n",

The theoretical basis of the framework is the life cycle theory, the gray system theory and the analytic hierarchy process. A quantity of real data should be collected by questionnaire, site survey scene and consulting of specialist and pretreated through unit conversion to take the associated data set as a class to deal with. The universality and peculiarity of carbon footprint in large-scale public building should be concluded on the basis of a great number of effective data. The quantitative analysis method should be used to confirm different weighting coefficients, the gray relational degrees of carbon footprint and its influencing factors in large public building. The theoretical analysis showed that the evaluate system is applicable to large public buildings of various kinds, and quality of comprehensive evaluation with this system shall be good. Carbon footprint analysis of large public buildings contributes to the allocation of limited resources for reducing regional greenhouse gas emissions.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Renewable energy sources are one key enabler to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and to cope with the anthropogenic climate change. Their intermittent behavior and limited storage capabilities present a new challenge to power system operators to maintain power quality and reliability. Additional technical complexity arises from the large number of small distributed generation units and their allocation within the power system. Market liberalization and changing regulatory framework lead to additional organizational complexity. As a result, the design and operation of the future electric energy system have to be redefined. Sophisticated information and communication architectures, automation concepts, and control approaches are necessary in order to manage the higher complexity of so-called smart grids. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art and recent developments enabling higher intelligence in future smart grids. The integration of renewable sources and storage systems into the power grids is analyzed. Energy management and demand response methods and important automation paradigms and domain standards are also reviewed.',\n",

In order to realize real-time, efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly management for resources, and ultimately promote the green production transformation, every enterprise needs to ponder the process of modern industry development. Based on the Industrial Internet of Things, this article discusses the green development mode of the food industry, and uses the entropy method to measure the environmental pollution index of China's food industry. Considering the issue of environmental pollution and energy consumption, the article uses the DEA-Malmquist method to measure the green total factor productivity of all types of China's food industry from 2006 to 2014. The results show that the environmental pollution index of China's food industry shows a rise -- fall -- rise trend from 2006 to 2014. The green total factor productivity of Chinese food industry shows a rising trend from 2006 to 2014. The average technical efficiency of China's food industry is low, but the technical efficiency shows a rising trend. The technical efficiency of the agricultural food processing industry remains effective.\",\n",

He proposes an extended entity-relationship model for the conceptual-schema representation, and an object-oriented model for the data structure representation. The mapping from the E/sup 2/R model to the object-oriented representation is quite natural. Problem representation, model building, and decision support under this approach are based on modeling by deduction which is implemented using three processes: instantiation, inheritance, and specialization.<<ETX>>',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Two-thirds of the overall primary energy in the world is consumed in cities, resulting in 71 percent of all energy related greenhouse gas emissions. There are many ongoing initiatives to develop strategies to lower the high amount of emissions at the level of cities. However, energy planners face problems that are related to the complexity of the urban energy systems, encapsulating the components of the city together with their properties and interactions that are relevant to the planning process. The complexity of the problem increases given the unavailability of data and their multiple levels of detail (LOD). Therefore, there is a need for adequate tools to support the development of integrated energy strategies, defining specific quantifiable CO2 reduction measures to be implemented at the city level. In this research, we perform an analysis of urban energy planning processes. Then, we extract the general requirements of decision support in this discipline. Then, we perform a general data availability review in cities. This process results in formalizing a modular methodology for the development of urban energy planning support software. This methodology is specific to urban energy planning, it ensures the modularity of the development process, it leads to flexible software that operates under different available LODs of data, and it addresses the problem of data availability at the development stage.',\n",

We propose a Multi-Agent Decision Support System (MADSS) architecture to integrate the different categories of knowledge representation. We describe the functionalities and capacities of cognitive agents implementing these different kinds of knowledge and bringing them to cooperate in elaborating the decision. Agents are able to commit to build sub-decisions and thus, the system provides a whole sequence of decisions fitting the user's usual cognitive scheme. We trust in a supervised architecture because such a MADSS must be goal driven by the user's requirements. However, the agents remain autonomous and keep the opportunity to commit or not to the task exhibited by the supervisor at the moment.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"The Industrial and Commercial sectors in South Africa consume more than 80% of the electricity generated by Eskom. The generation of electricity to meet the demand in these sectors is primarily derived from the coal thermal power plant. The goal of Eskom is to sustain the demand and equally reduce environmental pollution. Eskom has embarked on energy efficiency initiatives on their coal boiler plant in a bid to decrease the amount of coal burnt and in turn increase the electricity generated. The study focused on the analysis of the before and after outage data obtained from the unit cards in one of the Eskom's \\u201conce through\\u201d 600 MW coal boiler with a mechanical conversion efficiency of 35 % (from manufacturer specification). Multiple linear regression models were developed and built to predict the power generated and sent out in correlation with the predictors (average air heater temperature, average main stream super heater temperature, average high pressure heater temperature, the total mass of coal burnt, auxiliary power consumption, average of the cold well and hot well condenser temperature and pressure). The data obtained 3 months before and after an outage showed an average power generated of 434.95 MW and 502.08 MW respectively. The results also revealed that the cumulative energy gained was 44000 MWh. Finally, the reliefF algorithm ranked all predictors as primary factors with the high pressure heater and main stream super heater temperatures contributing the most by virtue of the weight of importance to the power generated.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'In this letter, we present a simplified scheduling scheme for packet transmission over a fading channel which is modeled as a finite-state block channel. We first address the optimal minimum power-transmission policy with constraints on both average delay and packet loss. The optimal policy requires a sophisticated table lookup for implementation. In order to alleviate this problem, we design a simplified transmission policy that is based on checking for three control parameters: a transmission-rate threshold; a channel-state threshold; and the transmission buffer size. Our results show that the minimum average power with the simplified scheme is very close to that achieved by the optimal policy. Further, modeling the simplified scheme via a single-server bulk-service queue, we derive approximations to the quality of service metrics, such as average power and delay, that allow for analytical insights into the policy design.',\n",

A microgrid, with its flexible scale and structure, can be a good platform to integrate distributed conventional and renewable generation resources. In this paper, a stochastic operation scheduling scheme is proposed to co-optimize carbon emissions and generation fuel costs while mitigating the impact of the intermittence of renewable energy. Two different stochastic approaches based on Sample Average Approximation and Probabilistic Constrained Stochastic Programming are formulated. Corresponding solution methods are developed and implemented in an experimental microgrid to illustrate and compare the effectiveness of different stochastic models for the intended applications.',\n",

The paper proposes a tool which integrates image segmentation and classification with the goal of providing accurate and timely information about the areas of study. Traditional methods involving image segmentation followed by classification have not lived up to their potential due to the inherent semantic gap between these two functions. Segmentation algorithms have been limited in their success in extracting objects of interest which in turn limits classification performance since the segmentation algorithm has no a priori knowledge of the objects in the image. Segmentation algorithms fail in one of two directions: (i) over-segmentation where the object of interest is divided into many smaller regions or (ii) under-segmentation where the object of interest is merged with irrelevant background information. Both problems can confound the classification process. The approach is demonstrated on aerial images from the Katrina disaster to be able to detect buildings that may have been damaged or displaced from their original positions.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"China is currently the world's largest producer and consumer of iron and steel. This industry is one of the most energy- and emission-intensive industries in China. It is unsuspicious that energy conservation and emission reduction in this industry are crucial for China to fulfill its obligations of reducing greenhouse gas emission and mitigating global climate change. An appropriate allocation of CO2 emissions permit is the most important precondition for establishing an efficient and effective emissions trading system that had recently been launched in China's pilot regions. This paper proposes a new emissions permit allocation method based on a Nash equilibrium data envelopment analysis model. This method is more appropriate in emissions permit allocation for China's iron and steel firms in an imperfectly competitive market where the product price is endogenous. A noncooperative game is formulated and the mixed complementarity problem is utilized to identify a Nash equilibrium in the allocation of emissions permit (AEP). The most up-to-date AEP using a unique data set of China's major iron and steel enterprises in 2014 is provided in this paper. The results show that the AEP improves the desirable output generation by satisfying the reduction targets of the undesirable outputs.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'When climate change mitigation strategies are discussed in reports such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published in 2001 (Metz et al, 2001), the authors inevitably center on reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and, to a lesser extent, reduction in aerosol emissions such as black carbon aerosols. Reductions of carbon emissions to the atmosphere includes strategies to not only capture and store carbon emissions from, for example, coal fired power plants, but also includes strategies such as increasing energy efficiency, greater use of renewable energy sources, and greater use of fuels that do not contain carbon (such as nuclear) or are carbon- neutral. Over the next several centuries most or all of the earth\\'s fossil fuel reserves (about 4000 Gt-C) may be consumed, with the hope that carbon capture and storage (CCS) will minimize future greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are not dangerous to the planet. However, as discussed in this paper, it may not be possible for repositories to reliably store the massive amounts of carbon generated without imposing environmental risks. Further, while control of global warming is of immediate concern, possibilities of other types of climate change exist. Abrupt changes could be triggered that, for example, might reduce the deep North Atlantic circulation and produce a cooling over much of the earth. Second, the earth has been in an interglacial warm period for over 10,000 years, and if the climate cycles observed in the previous 500,000 years continue, it is possible that the earth will return to a colder period. Ultimately, control of global cooling may be a more challenging problem than control of global warming. If reduction of greenhouse gas emissions turns out not to be the complete solution to climate change mitigation requirements (which may involve both warming and cooling periods), what is? In this paper, earth-based and space- based techniques are explored that are designed to supplement greenhouse gas reduction approaches. While the strategies presented here may be futuristic and expensive, they do provide us with an outlook on controlling global climate change that may spawn ideas for other mitigation techniques. General design considerations are presented based on a global energy balance model to predict global temperature changes not only in response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations, but also to changing conditions in the earth system, such as the net incoming solar radiation or the planetary albedo. The approaches are intended to perturb the earth\\'s energy balance in a controllable manner. Today, for example, data show that the earth is not in an equilibrium energy state. About 1.0 W/m<sup>2</sup> more energy is coming into the earth than is leaving, indicating that the earth is \"committed\" to this amount of global warming and its attendant consequences, even if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmospheredo not continue to increase. This energy imbalance is equivalent to a further warming of 0.5degC to 1degC, comparable to the observed global warming that has occurred over the past century. One benefit of the supplemental mitigation techniques would be to help \"uncommit\" earth from such energy imbalances, as well as to provide a basis for addressing future climate change.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"As a step towards the development of advanced image database systems with the objective of reducing the semantic gap between the user's view and the system's view, an integrated image database system which facilitates icon-driven spatial information definition and retrieval is proposed. Spatial (visual) characteristics of entities in an image can be defined and retrieved in a uniform way by drawing sketches of the entities and arranging them spatially on a two-dimensional screen. The approach taken is that of representing the requested characteristics as spatial knowledge visually in ordinary inference rules. Man-machine interaction facilities and a scheme of spatial characteristics extraction are extensively discussed as well.<<ETX>>\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Buildings are one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption in urban areas all around the world. The load demand of large buildings is highly uncertain due to large penetration of solar PV. As a result, it leads to serious power system stability and quality issues for network operators and energy managers. Therefore, accurately forecast the load demand of buildings is utmost important to design a better energy management system and reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, variable PV output power, random nature of weather, diversity and complexity of buildings are big hurdles to accurately predict the load demand. In this paper, a deterministic hybrid intelligent forecast framework is proposed based on a combination of cascade-forward back-propagation network (CFBPN) in ensemble network for accurate load demand forecast. The wavelet transform (WT) technique is applied to handle the sharp spikes and fluctuations in historical load demand data. In addition, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to train the CFBPN in ensemble network for better forecast accuracy. In proposed forecast framework, historical load demand data, temperature, wind speed and humidity are applied as ensemble model inputs. The performance of proposed model is analyzed for one day and 12 hours ahead load demand forecast of summer (S), autumn (A), winter (W) and spring (SP) days. The proposed forecast model provides higher forecast accuracy compared to autoregressive (AR) and wavelet transformed backpropagation neural network (WT+BPNN).',\n",

Hence, it is very important to construct a real-time monitoring system in order to solve the problem. In this paper, the hardware system is built to collect the environmental parameters including temperature, humidity, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>. The data is transmitted to the wireless router by wireless fidelity protocol. The remote server is developed for receiving data from sensor nodes through the Internet. Then the data will be saved to a database. The computer client and the mobile phone client are developed for querying data. A certain period of stability experiments shows that the system is reliable in practical applications. By using the system in a high building, the variation trend of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration of vertical height is found. The concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> is high near the ground. If the altitude is higher than a certain value, the concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> will decline as the altitude increasing.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Retrofitting the existing building stock is among the most important objectives and imperative to meet societal goals to reduce primary energy demand and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. District heating systems have proven to supply heat for buildings both energy and cost efficiently. Thermal microgrids (TMGs) can be understood as a subcategory of district heating systems: small scale, bidirectional, and potentially fed by different thermal sources. Given a suitable combination of loads, the number of and distance between buildings, they can offer economic and environmental advantages compared to the supply by individual heating systems per building. We present a novel method using data analysis techniques on georeferenced building stock data to identify suitable configurations of buildings that yield a cost-efficient TMG. For the identification, both semantic and spatial data from a database are combined using fuzzy logics and cost-benefit analysis. We apply the method using a case study featuring a database of 306 buildings potentially to be retrofitted. As a result, we can identify nine groups of 25 buildings that would form a microgrid featuring up to 17.4% cost benefits compared to an individual heat supply. This would save approximately 30% of the building-induced CO2emission of the community.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Stormwater discharges from construction activities can have significant impact on water quality by contributing sediments and pollutants to waterbodies. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for most States and the Construction General Permit (CGP) for a few states in the U.S. require the development and implementation of Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and Best Management Practices (BMPs), which should contain storm water collection and discharge points, and drainage patterns across construction projects. Generally, erosion and sedimentation from disturbed construction sites need to be controled before and after construction. This regulatory compliance frequently results in schedule delays or decreased productivity at the beginning of construction process and violations or failure to implement stormwater management on construction sites increases construction costs. Therefore, an appropriate SWPPP needs to be developed at the planning phase. This study explores the feasibility of utilizing BIM tools for SWPPP and BMPs developments.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"A lot of data has flowed under the bridge and across it since green IT started to find its way onto the green enterprise agenda; IT professionals can allow themselves a plaudit or two for showing leadership here, because it is through the 'greening' of the IT function that most organisational carbon management programmes entered corporate consciousness. At a time when the remit of the IT function itself was being undermined by executive forces alleging that IT was neither flexible nor amenable to the needs of 'the business', the environmentalist debate gave IT heads a platform to re-assert their status in the management hierarchy. It also restored some of the political clout IT formerly enjoyed: it was re-empowered to drive through changes.The economy is looking healthier now, and the green IT 'agenda' has moved on since 2005. The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme legislation has introduced a legal motivation for organisations to review their energy usage and take steps to implement policies and procedures that make carbon control intrinsic to the articles of their governance. However, as the recent Green Enterprise World Forum showed, the IT industry has passed beyond the awareness phase and must now concentrate its talents on shaping the the future green IT.The pursuit of green IT is perforce subject also to changes in working practices. The gradual but steady trend toward the so-called mobile enterprise is going to have important repercussions on the way IT is provisioned to business users and on the way it consumes energy. With mobile devices enabling large percentages of the workforce to work away from an office base, the requirement to provision multiple desktops (or docking stations), each with a network connection and power source, will become less crucial; and printer needs will decrease.\",\n",

The authors describe facets of their recent and ongoing research within the field of engineering systems to develop constructs and methods for architecting enterprises engaged in system-of-systems (SoS) engineering,. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop a framework for characterizing, designing, and evaluating SoS enterprise architectures throughout the system lifespan as various forces result in entering/exiting of constituent systems, changing environment, and shifting enterprise profile. The nature of systems-of-systems demands constructs for multi-dimensional architectural descriptions, as well as methods for design and evaluation that employ dynamic approaches. In this paper, two important elements in an emerging framework are described, including a holistic enterprise architecting framework and an epoch-based analysis method for examining possible futures of the SoS enterprise.',\n",

The implementation of this approach requires information synthesis across disciplines, domains, and geopolitical boundaries. The benefit of GEOSS is derived from two primary sources. First, GEOSS provides the ability to leverage Earth observations in order to make better, more informed decisions on key societal issues. Second, GEOSS incubates a value added sector that responds to emerging and to-be-developed market opportunities. The challenge, as we strive to entrain legacy assets, is to enable these benefits and not negatively impact existing operational strategies and approaches. In addition, the development approach needs to be mindful of the need for capacity building within developing countries. We explore these issues, identify three key technological enablers, and identify specific implications for information system providers that desire to participate in the GEOSS endeavor.',\n",

ZUMA is a centralized future smart-home platform that interconnects all kinds devices in the home environment. This paper mainly focuses on sensor network operation issues. The discussion is on the benefits that the centralized architecture can provide in typical sensor network operations that are node discovery, routing and data dissemination, power control, and security.

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"The potential for environmental, social, and economic advances enabled by information and communication technologies (ICTs) is tremendous: `Smart Grid' systems hold promise for resource conservation and climate change mitigation; innovations in ICT help transition countries from industrial to knowledge economies, and bridging the digital divide in developing countries can help achieve Millennium Development Goals worldwide: ending poverty, enabling universal education, and creating global partnerships. However, the benefit possible from global use of ICTs cannot be realized without a corresponding build up of digital infrastructure. This projected increase in ICT products is of particular concern to environmental sustainability, in large part due to the global health, safety, and environmental effects of managing these products in the waste stream. The ability to quantify and manage environmental impacts of ICT products is complicated by continuous evolution of product form and function. The work described herein provides an assessment of how changing form factor and material composition in common consumer electronics - desktop and notebook computers - may influence the electronic waste stream in the U.S. Results indicate that dematerialization on a per product basis is largely offset by increasing volumes of the total waste stream. From an economic standpoint, end-of-life value will be enhanced by the increasing use of lightweight materials such as aluminum and magnesium but potentially impacted by decreasing precious metal content. This paper also suggests that common design for end-of-life heuristics may be less applicable to ICT products undergoing rapid technological progress, as exemplified by the changing form factor and lightweighting of the consumer notebook computer.\",\n",

The aim of GRANI was to provide the NANO community with a scalable, distributed data management solution and a secure collaborative environment to ensure high speed access to and seamless sharing of their data, instruments, analytical services and expertise. A grid-enabled, distributed system was developed that links the major Australian microscopy instruments to an underlying distributed national imagery database, a network of microscopy experts, and image processing and analytical services through an authenticated Web/Grid Portal. The aspects that are particularly innovative and that will be described in depth include: (1) the nano image database (NIDB) - an indexed, distributed archive of images captured directly from the advanced instruments and copied to the National Data Facility using GridFTP; (2) access to APAC's high performance computing (HPC) facilities and grid environment for high speed file movement, image analysis and 3D reconstruction; and (3) real-time video conferencing and video annotation services to improve support for remote access to advanced microscopy instruments and experts.\",\n",

The applications are built onto a common software framework, which will be designed and implemented in the project. The framework can be used for developing diverse applications in a straightforward and cost- efficient way. It enables employing diverse data sources, preprocessing, analyzing and preparing the data into proper products, and delivering them at the right time, in the right form and via the appropriate channel to different end users that use diverse terminal equipment. The core of the framework consists of workflow management. A workflow description written in a workflow language represents the data process used in an application, and the workflow engine manages the execution of the process. The workflow tasks are implemented as web services, and the framework architecture utilizes XML-based standards like WSDL (Web service description language) and BPEL (business process execution language). The feasibility of the concept introduced by the software framework is verified by implementing several environment monitoring systems for the real-world applications in the areas of disaster monitoring, forestry, forest fire, maritime, traffic monitoring, disposal site monitoring, and season monitoring for tourism.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Global companies are beginning to recognize the health, safety, environmental and economic benefits of resource management programs that lead to a position of sustainable development. As a result, many such companies are developing and beginning to implement design practices that consider environmental aspects across all life stages of their products (raw material acquisition, manufacturing, packaging/distribution, use/service, and end-of-life management). The Ecobilan Group's Environmental Information & Management Explorer (EIME) tool was developed to enable eco-design practices in the electronics industry. To illustrate the utility of EIME, a case study performed by the Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) during pilot testing of the software is presented and discussed. Pilot study experience indicates that several enhancements to the tool are necessary for broad use. The Ecobilan Group is working in partnership with Kodak and potentially other stakeholders to further enhance the EIME tool. Enhancements that have been identified include expanding the capability to model product end-of-life alternatives, incorporating a single-figure eco-efficiency index for scoring environmental performance of products, expanding the current life cycle inventory database, and developing connectivity between EIME and predict data management libraries.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'In urban contexts, the use of energy in buildings is one of the main causes of greenhouse gas emissions. The reduction of energy-use in buildings could be one of the main drivers to improve the sustainability, livability and quality of urban environment, together with the production of energy from the available renewable sources. To achieve energy sustainability in the most critical high-density urban contexts, it is necessary to optimize: the energy consumptions compatibility of different users; the distribution of heat, for example through the district heating network; the use of all urban spaces, such as building envelopes and urban surfaces, to produce energy from the available renewable sources. The energy models at urban scale are a complex issue as they should be simplified to be applied on a vast territory. Indeed, detailed information are not given at territorial scale and short time of simulation are preferable; however, information should be detailed enough to describe properly the energy consumption of the whole urban environment from building to urban scale. Therefore, energy models should take into account also the urban morphology, people\\'s behavior, social and economic conditions, local and national regulation, and the use of outdoor public spaces. The challenge of this work is to present three different energy-use models, to compare their characteristics and to find the best features of an \"optimum\" model to analyze and represent energy resources, future scenarios, energy efficiency solutions and best energy policies. The aim is to drive a smarter use of energy, matching it with the available and more efficient energy sources to help also public administrations in defining policies adapted to the real buildings heritage. The urban energy models can also be applied in future climatic scenarios, to evaluate the impact of climate change in the energy demand/supply of buildings, as well as in the potential of retrofit scenarios.',\n",

By delivering to users \"infinite\" computing resources in a pay-as-you-go manner, cloud computing is turning into reality a dream that has long been cherished by the IT industry. For years, people have been hoping to achieve the abilities of continuously scaling up and of elastic resource utilizing, which now are within grasp. However, building a scalable data management system on existing commercial cloud platforms, such as Amazon EC2, poses a grand challenge. Indeed, new application requirements and the underlying hardware environment affect every aspect of the data management system, from individual components to system architecture. In this talk, we will present the opportunities and challenges of developing a scalable cloud data management system. First, we examine the anatomy of a cloud data intensive system. Then, we present three main challenges posed by a scalable cloud data processing system, i.e., multitenancy architecture, high throughout low latency transactions, and high performance reliable query processing. We will discuss why existing large-scale distributed systems such as peer-to-peer systems, distributed data management systems and massive parallel processing systems may not be able to deliver sufficient scalability, fault tolerance and satisfactory performance at cloud scale. Finally, we discuss possible solutions, consider current practices, and speculate the future of cloud computing.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Power management used to be a domain of mobile devices. Since energy bills and the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions from power plants are in everybody's mind, energy efficiency is a hot topic for each embedded system design. In the system design flow, trade off's between hardware and software functionality have a major impact on power saving, i.e. data compression, cryptography, highly utilized functions, etc. As a result, power management is distributed between hardware and software implementation features and therefore has to be developed and validated as early as possible in a single environment, requiring co-debug and co-verification capabilities. Additionally, power architectures add complexity to system debug and verification since each power mode has to be validated in combination with all valid features. The presentation will introduce the complexity problem of a power management system distributed among hardware and software layers and will discuss the debug and verification challenges on different commonly used development platforms from virtual prototyping to the final embedded system.\",\n",

These robots have to move to their destiantion so as to perform their function. For this purpose they need to be able to recognize the changes in the surrounding environment. They are equipped with a motion-planning method in order to avoid in real time collisions with other robots or obtacles. In this paper we propose a motion planning method based on PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap) algorithm. To evaluate our method, we constructed an experiment platform based on StarBED, which is a large-scale network testbed. By using the virtual environment manager Map Manager, the WLAN emulator QOMET, and the experiment-support software RUNE we are able to perform emulation of large-scale autonomous networked mobile robot systems. The experimental results confirm the usefulness of collaborative motion planning, which results in reaching faster the estimation and in less frequent re-planning.',\n",

We propose and investigate a novel Collective Travel Planning (CTP) query that finds the lowest-cost route connecting multiple sources and a destination, via at most$k$meeting points. When multiple travelers target the same destination (e.g., a stadium or a theater), they may want to assemble at meeting points and then go together to the destination by public transport to reduce their global travel cost (e.g., energy, money, or greenhouse-gas emissions). This type of functionality holds the potential to bring significant benefits to society and the environment, such as reducing energy consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions, enabling smarter and greener transportation, and reducing traffic congestions. The CTP query is Max SNP-hard. To compute the query efficiently, we develop two algorithms, including an exact algorithm and an approximation algorithm. The exact algorithm is capable finding the optimal result for small values of$k$(e.g.,$k = 2$) in interactive time, while the approximation algorithm, which has a$5$-approximation ratio, is suitable for other situations. The performance of the CTP query is studied experimentally with real and synthetic spatial data.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Localized communication networks for office automation, security monitoring, environmental management of buildings, computer communications, and other applications enjoy every increasing demand. This paper considers communication of data and analog message signals over electric power distribution circuits for such applications, using pseudonoise (PN) modulation. Advantages of power distribution circuits include reasonably universal coverage and easy access via a standard wall plug. Disadvantages include limited communication bandwidth, relatively high noise levels, and varying levels of impedance, noise, and attenuation. PN (spread-spectrum) signaling provides immunity to narrow-band signal impairments and casual eavesdropping, multiplexing capability, addressing capability, and easily implemented error rate versus data rate tradeoffs. The primary disadvantage is synchronization delay and hardware cost normally associated with PN code synchronization at the receiver. Our prototype modem avoids these difficulties by using the 60 Hz power line frequency for carrier, code, and data-bit synchronization. Design issues discussed include processing gain optimization, modem impedance specification, carrier frequency selection, and PN code selection. Prototype modem circuitry costing less than $30.00 is described. Measurements on actual power distribution circuits indicate a bit-error probability<tex>p = 10^{-4}</tex>or less at data rate<tex>R_{B} = 6</tex>kbits/s for single users or at<tex>R_{B} = 60</tex>bits/s for<tex>M \\\\simeq 22</tex>simultaneous users.

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'In recent years, eco-friendly driving or ecodriving technologies are being developed to assist human drivers to achieve maximum fuel/energy efficiency in different driving conditions. Enhanced by V2X wireless communications, connected ecodriving is expected to be very promising in reducing transportation-related fossil fuel consumption as well as pollutant emissions. Besides, the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) also has great potential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of batteries as the sole energy source. Although recent research shows that significant energy savings can be achieved with the aid of ecodriving systems in real-world driving, there have been very few research efforts that consider human driver error, especially for electric vehicle (EV) driving. In this paper, a connected cooperative ecodriving system for energy-efficient driving that considers human driver error is designed and evaluated with an EV energy consumption model. Real-world driving data were collected and used to evaluate system performance in terms of energy consumption. The simulation and numerical analysis shows that an average of 12% energy savings can be achieved by the proposed system that considers human driver error comparing with the conventional ecodriving system without considering driver error.',\n",

Often they also need to communicate information back and forth with other mobile users or with a central agency. Depending upon the task, the user may have to share or switch between different databases or different views of the same database. We first describe our efforts to create a consistent visualization of different spatial geographic databases consisting of aerial imagery, AutoCAD drawings, schematic diagrams, and street maps. The location of a mobile user is obtained via GPS (global positioning system) and visualized synchronously across different visualizations. Our focus then is to support the mobile user in visually accessing and querying the spatial GIS databases. The mobile or the central user can interact with the database in real-time and communicate the information to each other over wireless networks. The system supports a variety of queries and tasks (\"how far\", \"where\", \"closest\" etc.) for many different types of geometric primitives (points, lines, polygons etc.) and objects (buildings, metro stops etc.). The output results can then be unobtrusively and consistently displayed to the user across multiple views of the scene.',\n",

That is why it is great importance to increase energy efficiency on large scale. New advanced power analysis platforms and new control algorithms are developed, in order to administrate the electricity consumption. I intended to give a clear image and a better understanding of the airport's power consumption. That is because data analysis is easy to be used for monitoring energy efficiency and elaborating optimization measures to improve power performance. Based on the measurements achieved in real time and control devices, the following characteristic curves have been extracted for the airport lighting systems.

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Existing network management architectures suffer from a set of architectural and integration problems. Policy-based management was targeted to solve most of these problems, but its promises have not yet been fully realized. This paper presents a new approach to building network management solutions that is based on a new version of the DEN information model, called DEN-ng. DEN-ng is being designed to solve these problems by providing facilities to translate the business rules and procedures of an organization to the policies that configure and control its networks. Accordingly, the case is made for policy to become more than \"just\" a means for executing a change in a configuration file. Rather, it should be used to tie together configuration changes with how the changes should be done using a workflow system. This holistically binds business rules to the construction and deployment of configuration changes and their management.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Energy efficiency is in the interest of everyone, from individuals to governments, since it yields economical savings, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and alleviates energy poverty. Buildings are one of the largest consumers of primary energy and attaining their efficiency is, therefore, an important goal. The Internet of Things currently provides vast amounts of data that can be used to extract knowledge of all kinds, including that regarding energy prediction. This has motivated us to test wether the prior information on the physics of building heat transfer, that is currently available is now redundant owing to the completeness of the data from the system. We propose a machine learning approach and a grey-box model approach with which to test this hypothesis. The former is blind to the physiscs of the problem, while the latter is greatly influenced by it. The energy consumption prediction models were created with both approaches and then used to estimate energy consumption in a normal operation state and compare it with energy consumption when an energy efficiency campaign is run. Our black-box method, which is based on a combination of statistical and machine learning models and on a time series structurization of the data, shows better prediction accuracy than the so-called grey-box methods that include basic physical equations. This shows that also a data driven approach outperforms more informed methods in this, like other fields.',\n",

This paper examines some of the difficult data management issues in designing systems for computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW).

We discuss the issues of managing shared data in such systems, reducing information overload and providing group awareness and access control. We discuss several promising approaches to these issues. We point out where a significant gap remains in addressing the requirements of such systems and where designers have to make design trade-offs that can be difficult to evaluate. Finally, we discuss several open issues for future work.\",\n",

The Energy Management System (EMS) is a very important component of a PHEV in achieving better fuel economy and it is a very active research area. So far, most of the existing EMS strategies just simple follow predefined rules that are not adaptive to changing driving conditions; other strategies as starting to incorporate accurate prediction of future traffic conditions. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning based PHEV energy management system is designed to autonomously learn the optimal fuel use from its own historical driving record. It is a fully data-driven and learning-enabled model that does not rely on any prediction or predefined rules. The experiment results show that the proposed model is able to achieve 16.3% energy savings comparing to conventional binary control strategies.',\n",

The role of human settlements is becoming more and more important in land management, and the various structures of urban areas differ tremendously depending on social and historical backgrounds. So, beyond land-use and land-cover information, it is the urban composition that explains for social disparities, vulnerability to natural hazards, and deficits in urban and regional planning. In this study, first steps are presented towards and urban structural analysis using a multi-sensoral approach. With very high spatial resolution imageries, remote sensing offers techniques well-applicable to measure and monitor intra-urban heterogeneties. Imageries from Quickbird sensor and TerraSAR-X device, Spotlight mode, are taken to delineate field-mapped and well-defined urban structure types (UST). A robust rule base will be built which allows for accurate classifications and interpretation of typical-man-made structures. The most typical structural characteristics of urban regions are alignment and type of buildings, open and green spaces, and transportation network.',\n",

To detect the buildings developed in and around the city at present, Landsat-7 ETM+ and SPOT panchromatic imagery of 2001 were collected. To make use of higher spatial resolution of the SPOT panchromatic imagery and higher spectral resolution of the ETM+ imagery, the two data sources were fused. To reduce the confusion between urban built-up areas and non built-up areas, an unsupervised classification was performed first. Agricultural and large urban green and open areas such as parks and lakes were separated from other built-up areas. Major roads were mapped from ETM+ band8. Buildings were then extracted from the SPOT PAN imagery within the built-up areas using a set of proposed high-pass filters. Traditional Chinese-style houses, which are small in size and unidentifiable individually from the satellite imagery, were not detected. Our result shows that many medium-to-large buildings of regular arrangement can be mapped from the fused dataset. The buildings extracted from the satellite imagery can provide useful information for urban change detection and environmental management.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Energy use is crucial to our way of living and is fundamental for sustainable development, but often negatively affects human health and the environment. Around 60 percent of low-income households on the South African Highveld rely on solid fuels to meet their energy needs (cooking, water heating and space heating, especially in winter), despite being electrified. The aim of this research is to optimise energy use mix in a typical low-income household on the Highveld for least cost, lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and lowest particulate matter (with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 \\u03bcm - PM10) emissions. The study employs secondary data from Eskom's air quality offsets pilot project in KwaZamokuhle and other studies on energy use patterns. The energy requirements and constraints for an insulated, formal house are expressed as linear programming problems. The solutions reveal that using coal for cooking, space and water heating, and electricity for lighting and appliances, is the least cost option. However, for lowest CO2 and PM10 emissions, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) is most suitable for cooking, space heating and water heating, and electricity is preferred for lighting and appliances. These findings suggest that policies and initiatives that encourage LPG and electricity use should improve air quality in low-income communities and aid in climate change mitigation, but will not be sustainable unless the LPG or electricity is affordable for households.\",\n",

Regulation compliance is a complex process and offers many challenges in the design and implementation of a regulatory information management system that is able to support the regulation compliance process. It is important to first gain an understanding of the information flow in the regulation and compliance process, and to develop appropriate IT tools for building such a system. Focusing on environmental regulations related to hazardous waste management, we investigate the issues towards building an information infrastructure for a compliance assistance framework. This paper describes a prototype distributive regulation framework for: (1) the management of regulations and related information to support compliance assistance; (2) an Internet-based information management system; and (3) supporting the interoperability among the parties (regulatory agencies, businesses and third party waste handling facilitators), who are involved in the environmental regulation compliance process.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Large data centers are usually built to support the enormous computation and storage capability of Cloud Computing which has attracted people's attention nowadays. However, such large scale data centers generally consume an enormous amount of energy, which not only increases the running cost but also simultaneously enhances their greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing this issue, Virtualization technology is introduced, through which multiple Virtual Machines(VMs) can be centralized to fewer servers while allowing the idle servers to be dynamically powered off in order to save the energy consumption. In the paper, we investigate the impact of Virtualization technology on the energy and performance in data center environment taking into consideration various factors such as server failures and the overhead introduced by the VM contention. Noticing that there exits a tradeoff between energy consumption and execution time, we propose a stochastic model of data centers using Queueing theory to optimize performance and energy consumption. From the data center operators' prospective, they are willing to do better business by saving the energy consumption while abiding by the SLAs. Therefore, we try to find an optimal Energy-Performance tradeoff policy for the data center operators to operate data centers. The simulation results show that our model can significantly reduce the energy consumption by up to 35.4 while sacrificing a little execution time.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Energy consumption in large scale data centers (LSDCs) doubled from 2000 to 2006 reaching 61 TerraWatt-hour (TWh) per year. Nearly all of the energy consumed by IT equipment dissipates as heat from the servers, creating a real problem of efficiently cooling LSDCs. Reducing the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of a data center by even small fractions significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We propose a novel Pulsed Variable Flow Rate (PVFR) dynamic cooling control strategy for liquid cooled LSDCs, based on the principle of pulsed power delivery instead of continuous power supply. We built a proprietary simulation software called DynaCool using model-driven design to evaluate the effectiveness of PVFR approach. An early evaluation shows that DynaCool achieves a PUE reduction of at least 15.4% over existing static and variable flow rate cooling control strategies. Assuming an adoption rate of 10%, PVFR would yield power savings of 1.88 TWh or greenhouse gas emission savings of 284,000 tons per year.',\n",

With South Africa generating more than 90% of her electricity from coal, there exists vast opportunities to reduce energy demand through energy efficiency and augment energy supply through solar energy. In an effort to demonstrate energy efficiency and solar energy technologies in the residential sector, an energy efficient building with integrated photovoltaics was built at the University of Fort Hare, Alice campus. The building integrated photovoltaic generator (BIPV) performs a dual role and also offsets the initial cost of roofing material.

In this context, reducing data center energy consumption is one of the main tasks to focus on, since these facilities concentrate a great share of an ICT service provider's power demand in a small number of locations. The adoption of commercial energy-saving solutions, based on static configurations, introduces significant improvements, but considerable infrastructure underutilization levels remain. In order to allow ICT service providers to overcome the limitations found in existing energy efficiency tools, this paper describes an infrastructure management solution which dynamically adjusts the performance of the managed environment to match service demand, thus optimizing energy consumption. Additionally, the first validation experiences of the proposed management solution in the context of a telecom operator's service provisioning infrastructure are described.\",\n",

In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), interconnected smart devices change the application-programming paradigm of buildings. Smart building system and people cloud work in a more collaborative way for improving the energy efficiency. Obtaining fine-grained environmental information and controlling networked remote device are enabled through open web-based services. Writing flexible rules, which can utilize available services to control electricity appliances to act properly based on the acquired context for energy efficiency becomes possible. However, the complexity of a building makes it very complicated for non-expert users write energy control policy without studying the target building in detail. Hence, we proposed a user-friendly energy policy description language, called EPDL and implement a set of components to support the user in writing energy control policy easily for smart buildings. We discussed the readability and writability of EPDL, and showed it is an efficient tool for a non-expert user to write energy control policies for smart buildings.',\n",

In this paper, we presented the mortality and morbidity effects of PM10 pollution, based on statistical data and the epidemiological exposure-response function. It was estimated that the total economic cost of health impacts due to particulate air pollution in urban areas of Dalian in 2006 was approximately 573.862 million US dollars(2006 exchange rate), accounting for 2.14% of gross domestic product (GDP). The results suggest that the impact of particulate air pollution on human health could be substantial in urban Dalian, whether in physical and economic terms. So, it's important to make more efforts in investment and management of environmental protection so as to reach the coordinated development of economy and environment. Energy policies and effective measures should be proposed to reduce particulate matter, especially PM10 pollution in Dalian to protect public health.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'As a green renewable resource, wind energy has been emphasized to solve the problem of world energy crisis and environmental pollution. Prediction of the effective wind power density is a significant work for wind power evaluation. In this paper, the effective wind power density values are regarded as a time series, furthermore, Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) and Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) are employed to forecast the effective wind power density in the future. Both the two models predict the effective wind power density only based on historical data and statistical calculation, combining the long term prediction and the short term prediction. Forecasting and calculation results show that the neural networks have strong learning ability that can well capture the random changes of time series researched. Compared the forecasting results of the two neural networks mentioned above, the Back Propagation Neural Networks performs better than the Generalized Regression Neural Networks for effective wind power density prediction in Hexi Corridor.',\n",

In contrast, massive connectivity and demand for higher data rate promise the presence of new generation of cellular system (5G) and small cell networks. Hence, expectation on increasing the number of base stations (BSs), which leads to increase in energy usage. One way to improve energy consumption is by shutting down the redundant BSs while sustaining the Quality-of-Service (QoS) for each user. In this paper, we propose a dynamic structural algorithm based on transportation problem, to switch on/off the BSs in cellular networks without compromising its coverage, and maintain the networks load by neighboring cells. We use weighted graphs to translate our problem as a transportation problem and then use linear programming to solve it. The cost of transport, turning a BS into sleep mode, is illustrated as a function of energy usage, coverage area and load on the BSs. Running the proposed method consecutively provides the maximum number of BSs whom are at sleep mode. The methodology explained in this paper reduces energy consumption to almost 40%, whereas maintaining all the existing loads in the network.',\n",

Another trend is the use of component frameworks for building network services. Their component-based nature makes such applications natural candidates for distributed deployment, but it is unclear if the design patterns underlying component frameworks also enable efficient service distribution. In this paper, we investigate the application design rules and accompanying system-level support essential to a beneficial and efficient service distribution process. Our study targets the widely used Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) component platform and Java Pet Store, a sample component-based e-commerce application. Our results present strong experimental evidence that component-based applications can be efficiently distributed in wide-area environments using a small set of generally applicable design rules for orchestrating interactions and managing component state. We additionally discuss enforcement of these rules, and their automated implementation by container frameworks.',\n",

Those flat rates do not relate and reflect the true and time-varying costs of electricity supply during actual time of consumptions. Without acknowledging the cost differences, consumers do not have any incentive to adjust their load consumption patterns, and inefficiencies of resource allocations can result. Crises and markets failures are often originated from these wholesale and retail market disconnections. Our previously proposed load control strategies (Steps of Temperatures and Pricing Naming) are implemented and integrated to our prototype. The system can serve as a tool to assist end-use residential consumers for their load and budget managements in real-time pricing environments, like Illinois (where 4.5 million consumers can participate in such program). Other features can further add-on to enhance the proposed system (e.g., home security and surveillance system).',\n",

In this paper, we study the wirelessly powered IoT networks, in which a central node transmits radio frequency (RF) energy to power the IoT sensors, and the sensors harvest RF power to transmit data back to the central node. In this IoT network, the sensors transmit data according to their energy utilization policies, and the central node allocates charging powers to all sensors. We design the sensor energy utilization policies and the power allocation among sensors by maximizing the total data throughput of the system. In particular, the subproblem of energy utilization policy design is formulated as a Markov decision process and the power allocation subproblem is formulated as discrete optimization. By showing several key properties of these two subproblems, we propose low-complexity algorithms to solve the subproblems optimally. We demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed algorithms over some simple heuristics via simulations in terms of the total data throughput in wireleslly powered IoT networks.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'CoolEmAll project aims at improving energy-efficiency of data centers. The main results of CoolEmAll include data center Simulation, Visualization and Decision tools (SVD Toolkit) and models of Data Center Efficiency Building Blocks (DEBBs). The resulting tools of CoolEmAll will permit planners and operators of data centers to carry out flexible and fast simulations to minimize the energy consumption on it and to reduce the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Several metrics have been proposed to assess the energy efficiency on data centers on the framework of CoolEmAll project. Unlike the common metrics on data center industry, the ones proposed in this project are focused not only on power consumption but also on dynamic heat-aware analysis. New metrics developed on CoolEmAll are (a) the Imbalance of Temperature of node, group of nodes and racks and (b) Rack Cooling Index adapted to a group of nodes. Node is defined as the smallest element of a data center to be modeled. This approach will permit to detect the cooling requirements and its source in order to implement strategies to reduce that energy demand. The paper describes the selected metrics and the results obtained on the CoolEmAll first prototype experimental tests.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Energy consumption and carbon emissions in Iran have risen rapidly in recent years which is not acceptable regarding environmental regulations. Government officials have been trying to resolve this problem, but so far there has been less success. Exergy analysis method is a powerful tool, which has been successfully used for estimating energy utilization efficiencies of countries. In this study, energy and exergy analysis models for agricultural and utility sectors of Iran are applied. Energy and exergy analysis are performed for two devices (pumps, tractors) in agricultural sector and two subsectors (power plants and hydroelectric) in utility sector. The analyses are based on the actual data presented by ministry of energy officials over the period 1994-2006. The energy and exergy efficiencies in agricultural sector of Iran during 1994-2006 are found to range from 29% to 41.7%, and from 16.9% to 20.2% respectively, and in the utility sector are obtained to range from 33.44% to 39.27%. The result was compared with other countries and it is seen that energy and exergy efficiencies in Iran is higher than some countries and lower than some others. However, it cannot be deduced that one country is better than another, because exergy efficiency depends on different factors like climate, population and structure of energy system and the main differences resulted from the structure of the country. It is seen that exergy efficiency of agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia is higher than that of Iran. However as stated above it can not be concluded that agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia is better than in Iran. It is seen that countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Malaysia which the contribution of power plants in electricity generation is about 90%, have low exergy efficiencies in utility sector. This is due to the fact that irreversibilities of thermal power plants are relatively high compared to hydroelectric power plants.',\n",

This research aims at modeling the energy consumption of machine tools after they are maintained preventively. The relationship between reliability and energy consumption is modeled based on historical data and then the energy consumption of a machine tool is calculated. Reliability is modeled by Weibull distribution, the parameters of which are estimated utilizing the Maximum Likelihood Estimation method. Reliability after preventive maintenance is modeled by employing Malik's Proportional Age Reduction model.

Heterogeneous deployments of different cell types have been used to fulfill the challenges mentioned above. In this respect, a critical concern for operators is how to deploy small cells in a green manner such that the global network is cost-effective as well as energy-efficient. In this paper, we characterize the energy efficiency (EE) and deployment efficiency (DE) for heterogenous wireless networks, taking into account realistic network power consumption model and dynamic network configuration. We give first order closed form analysis to address this issue and show that a proper density of small cells is required to obtain the maximum achievable EE/DE.

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'There is no need to stress the importance of telecommunication industry in the global economy. Web hotel applications pose a peculiar problem for compensating very high thermal power inside rather restricted spaces. Distinctive features of this refrigerating installations are high evaporation temperature and high flow rate of cooling air, whereas latent heat load is absent. The typical system used in this Held is a direct expansion refrigerating unit, with air cooled condenser and operates on R407C refrigerant. Typical values for the evaporation temperature are around 10degC, with the process air cooled down to 26degC, but applications exist with high density of heat load that can operate with 30divide35degC air temperature at the evaporator inlet. Nowadays synthetic refrigerants, such as R407C, are increasingly under pressure from environmentalists and from a greater part of the society in industrialised countries since they raise great concern about the future of the planet, because of their high GWP potential. Natural refrigerants, such as ammonia, hydrocarbon and CO2 are seen as the ultimate solution for this environmental problem, but the first two fluid hardly can be considered as viable alternative to synthetic refrigerants because their unfavourable safety characteristics. CO2 is indeed safe, cheap, easily available, its ODP is zero and its GWP is negligible, even zero, if the fluid is recovered from waste of industrial processes; the dark side of CO2 can be energy efficiency because of its low critical temperature, that often makes the refrigerating machine operate according to a transeritieal cycle; this means that high temperature heat rejection does not involve two phase transformation (condensation) but only gas cooling (consequently the heat exchanger is named gas cooler). Nevertheless, according to common opinion, this thermodynamic penalisation can be, at least partially, counterbalanced by its very good characteristics of heat transfer and pressure drop. Another strong point of CO2 is the possibility of running with a rather low flow rate of the cooling medium at the gas cooler. In any case, the penalisation in energy efficiency with respect to traditional compression vapour inverse cycle is decreasing when the temperature lift from the lower to the upper cycle temperature is shrinking. Since high evaporation temperature is typical of the refrigeration systems in use in web hotel, CO2 transeritieal cycle can be considered an effective alternative to traditional installations. In the paper a theoretical analysis is carried out, aimed at comparing the energy efficiency characteristics of CO2 transeritieal cycle with the ones of the application on the market. Different transeritieal cycles are analysed. The effects of independent variable, such as upper and lower cycle pressures and the mass flow rate of air at the heat exchangers are investigated.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'The Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are an integral component of the Indian economy. SMEs consists of many energy intensive industries such as foundry, forging, steel re-rolling mills, glass and ceramics, bakeries, brick manufacture, food processing etc. The primary source of energy for these industries is coal, biomass, petroleum and electricity. Energy consumption in each of these industries is of high intensity and magnitude. Among them, the brick making units are generally confined to rural and semi-urban areas. Though they make an important contribution to the economy in terms of employment and rural development, majority of them are traditionally operated using energy inefficiently at the cost of environmental degradation. Hence, efficient use of energy is one of the pre-conditions for sustainable development of such units. The improved Energy-Efficiency helps not only in enhancing competitiveness through cost reduction, but also in minimizing environmental degradation. In this backdrop, the current paper probes various issues pertaining to energy and environment in an energy intensive brick industry cluster in India. Based on the primary data from 50 randomly selected units, the importance of energy input is established using a Cobb-Douglas production function. The energy consumption pattern and associated environmental pollution are also studied. The results revealed that energy as the most important contributor to the value of output amongst all inputs. Further, the results of this study have useful policy implications for ensuring sustainable growth of the SME sector.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Event detection is an important part in many Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications such as forest fire, environmental pollution. In this kind of applications, the event must be detected early in order to reduce the threats, damages. In this paper, we propose a new approach for early forest fire detection, which is based on the integration of Data Mining techniques into sensor nodes. The idea is to partition the node set into clusters so that each node can individually detect fires using classification techniques. Once a fire is detected, the corresponding node will send an alert to its cluster-head. This alert will then be routed via gateways, other cluster-heads to the sink in order to inform the firefighters. The approach is validated using the CupCarbon simulator. The results show that our approach can provide a fast reaction to forest fires with efficient energy consumption.',\n",

Saving energy will not only reduce operating cost but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which is important for combating climate change. The authors propose energy-efficient user grouping algorithms to provide power minimisation of grouped multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) and space-time block coding MC-CDMA systems in a cellular environment. Depending on the channel fading conditions, power control is utilised to minimise the total transmitted power under a bit error rate constraint. When the allocation is performed without a fair data rate requirement, the authors provide the optimal solution to the minimisation problem. However, when some fairness is considered, the optimal solution requires high computational complexity. Thus, the authors solve the problem by proposing two suboptimal algorithms. Simulation results illustrate a significantly reduced power consumption in comparison with other techniques.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'The number of residential buildings in many countries has been fast growing. Comfortable furniture and smart peripheral devices become common for well living in daily life. For example, an electronic wireless switch could be controlled via a mobile phone to open or close home appliances (i.e. light, air-conditioner, security and alarm system), it is so-called \"Home Appliances Control\". This paper demonstrated a simple-wireless standalone system for the case of the receiver module attached to the compressor unit of the conventional air conditioner. This research proposed an air-compressor as a source of discrete excitations and employed a conventional buzzer as a transducer. The vibration is harvested its mechanical energy to electricity by using a cantilever-type structure glued with the piezoelectric buzzer. The output energy is stored in capacitors thus being consequent as a miniature generator; then, the transmitted data is received by a wireless receiver from the remote transmitter. These result confirmed that the simple cantilever could act as a charger for the connected capacitors which was subsequently an energy source to feed wireless units. In this work, a running air-conditioner produced a charging cycle to capacitors of 3,150 \\u03bcF within 1 hour. This is sufficient to send and receive the data of atmospheric temperature around the building. This application is useful as a warning sign for inhabitants.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Exergy analysis of a 500 MWe steam turbine cycle is performed to identify the components that offer significant work potential saving opportunity. Criteria of performance relevant to the individual components are formulated. Exergy flows, exergy consumption due to irreversibilities and rational performance parameters for the turbine cycle and its components are computed by using plant operation data under different conditions. Energy efficiency of the turbine cycle is low due to large energy rejection, but the derived exergy efficiency of the turbine cycle is high due to low exergy rejection from the cycle. Part load operation exhibits lower energy efficiency due to higher energy rejection relative to net output. On the contrary, exergy rejection from the cycle relative to net output does not increase during low load operation. Results show that poor part load exergy efficiency is due to higher exergy destruction relative to net output. Higher pressure feed heaters deal with larger exergy and therefore, need more attention to improve cycle efficiency. Operation and maintenance decisions based on exergy analysis have proved to be more effective in reducing inefficiencies in operating power plant. Exergy-based approach of performance analysis will help practicing power engineers manage energy resources and environment better.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Extension of battery lifetime has always been a major issue for mobile computing. While more and more data are involved in mobile computing, energy consumption caused by I/O operations becomes increasingly large. In a pervasive computing environment, the requested data can be stored both on the local disk of a mobile computer by using the hoarding technique, and on the remote server, where data are accessible via wireless communication. Based on the current operational states of local disk (active or standby), the amount of data to be requested (small or large), and currently available wireless bandwidth (strong or weak reception), data access source can be adaptively selected to achieve maximum energy reduction. To this end, we propose a profile-based I/O management scheme, FlexFetch, that is aware of access history and adaptive to current access environment. Our simulation experiments driven by real-life traces demonstrate that the scheme can significantly reduce energy consumption in a mobile computer compared with existing representative schemes.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Strategic decisions regarding fuels used to meet the University of Virginia's current and future steam demand require an in-depth understanding of the operations of the University of Virginia's Main Heat Plant. The current mix of fossil fuels that the Main Heat Plant depends on to heat the University is constrained in numerous ways, including: the University of Virginia's natural gas allotments, the contractual curtailments on natural gas set by the City of Charlottesville, the University of Virginia's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and financial costs. This paper focuses on developing an 8760 (24 hours \\xd7 365 days) model that compares multiple what-if scenarios on key measures through simulating the performance of the plant during a year at one hour increments. These scenarios evaluate the effects of changes to the aforementioned constraints and also to increases in demand. Operators at the Main Heat Plant will use the model through an interface that allows them to observe the performance of the system and explore different alternatives by selecting specific scenarios. Summary graphics for parameters such as greenhouse gas emissions, fuel usage, and cost provide decision makers in the plant and in University of Virginia administration with information needed to make strategic decisions regarding the Main Heat Plant and related fuel agreements. The simulated results were validated through a comparison against actual data collected from July 2016 to June 2017, resulting in 65% of modeled fuel states, matching the historical fuel states for the same periods.\",\n",

In these models, fully convolutional networks achieve unprecedented success in image segmentation tasks [6]. In this paper, we apply the contemporary image segmentation models in the context of extracting buildings and roads from high spatial resolution imagery. We estimate the influence of filter stride, learning rate, input data size, training epoch and fine-tuning on model performance. Selected Massachusetts road and building datasets are used for training, validation, and testing the performance of the models with different parameters. As a result of combining shallow fine-grained pooling layer outputs with the deep final-score layer or abandoning coarse-grained pooling layers, the extraction precision rate of the best modified model improves significantly to over 78%.',\n",

With the emergence of the 5G of wireless networks and the deployment of billions of base stations to the connected devices, the requirement for system design and energy efficiency management will become more attractive. In addition, in the next era of cellular, the energy efficiency is the most important requirement determined by the needs in reducing the carbon footprint of communications, and also in extending the life of the terminal battery.

At present, the population is protected against acoustic noise by different screens. Such screens can contain resonant absorbers, can have irregular edges or other constructive features providing the protection from the air noise. However, the noise propagating in air is not the main factor of the environmental pollution near the highways. The main part of energy, about 70%, penetrates into the ground. The experiments were performed inside dwelling territory in Moscow and at the Siberian testing territory. The recordings show that the seismic noise spectrum looks as a white noise containing two outbursts in the range of 0.5-1.0 Hz and 7.5-8.7 Hz. The second range was proved to be correspond to the local resonant geological structure in the testing area. In other cases, the observed resonance can be connected with the highway construction. These waves generated by traffic propagate along the ground and cause the vibration of buildings the eigen frequencies of which lye usually in the same frequency range. This investigation shows that the main infrasonic impact on people in buildings is produced by seismic waves. The data on noise and vibration level produced by Moscow subway are presented as well. The theoretical explanation of the observed phenomena is given.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Commercial off-the-shelf repository management systems claim to provide a solid basis for building CASE tools by offering special meta data management facilities (like versioning, configuration management, long transactions support). Another important area of application for these systems is the management of meta data in data warehouse environments. The ISO-IRDS standard defines a framework for the modeling of repository data. The paper describes a case study that implements a generic graphical modeling tool (GraMMi) on top of such a repository management system using the IRDS standard to guide the design process. To show the feasibility of our approach, we present a case study where GraMMi is used for the conceptual design of data warehouse models based on a specific modeling technique. The paper describes the overall system architecture, the object oriented design (including the repository schema) and the user interface design. Furthermore, we present experiences from the implementation of the system using an industry-standard platform (Softlab Enabler as the repository system and Visual C++ for implementing the modeling tool).',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Pakistan, a 70 years old independent state is still in the grip of serious power shortage and has still not been able to meet its demand of power generation. As a result, all sections of lives have been adversely affected. Carbon Dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is the main pollutant that is warming Earth. Industrial activities affect the ecosystem as it produces twice more CO<sub>2</sub> than natural processes can absorb. Reducing energy demands by focusing more on electricity generation could be costly and can impair human health as well as ecosystem. It is vital to focus on discovering possible innovative ways to save energy or create green environment rather than on the generation of energy. In this paper, a linear mathematical model is built and validated based on the measurements of real-time power consumption data. Later, the work focuses on deploying energy efficient techniques to reduce energy consumption and create green environment. The results show that the model can be utilized to forecast the power consumption behaviour as well as assess the impact of implementing different energy efficient schemes, where the goal is to find the level of power consumption to accommodate ourselves within power consumption budget.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Building is responsible for more than 40 percent of energy consumption and one third of greenhouse gas emissions. Europe has stablished the path towards nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB), soon required in every new construction and large renovation in existing buildings by 2020. Achieving nZEB required the use of photovoltaic modules for generating electricity. In Vietnam, photovoltaic systems are in most cases not used in building today. This research, we aim to implement the platform that will be dedicated to prototyping and tools to support research training in the reference building. In order to achieve nZEB, a 15 kWp of PV array will be installed in the rooftop of this building to compensate the energy needed. The objectives are to benefit from PV source, to improve energy efficiency and to reduce cost of electrical consumption in different scenarios. The Photovoltaic simulation tool is important in predicting the energy production from the solar panels. The first study investigates the use of a simulation tool PVSYST as a method of informing the design decision of building installed photovoltaic system. Input to the simulation software such as meteorological data has been evaluated.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Through the recent decades, XML became the most standard method for representing and exchanging information on the Web environments due to its flexibility in textual visualization, information modeling, information retrieval, document exchange, document management, and data mining. XML can provide hierarchal arrangement of data through some major techniques available for accessing and manipulating the XML documents. DOM is a widely used data model for memory representation of the documents, but had shown some shortage in parsing and representing large or very large documents. Wasting resources and processing time overhead are results of applying large XML documents to the DOM parser. SGML is the XML parent. It was using GROVE (graph representation of property value) as its abstract data model to solve the problems that encountered into the SGML family and as a standardized data model that represents the information contained within the SGML document. Grove is defined formally by a data modeling language called property set. In this paper, the grove idea is popularized as a data model that might solve DOM's problems. The grove is being built by a grove builder. Using Grove will provide addressing and enable the messages between sites to specify which nodes are to be affected. Groves also will bring acceptable results of the memory overhead and the time required for processing an xml file.\",\n",

The facility is a part of the Interstate 64 subsystem and consists of two bridges at each end connected by two two-lane tunnels. This system has been operating successfully since November 15, 1977. The system provides the means for improving vehicular throughput and reducing congestion, improving the management of vehicle incidents and facility operations, improving motorist information, improving environmental conditions, and improving traffic data collection. A control room situated in one of the four tunnel ventilation buildings is the nucleus of the traffic management activities. The system enables vehicle flow control of tunnel access; incident detection, incident verification, and incident operations management; automatic response to environmental and overheight problems; hardware monitoring of the signs, signals, and vehicle detectors; execution of major traffic operations on the faculty upon operator request; and daily reporting and logging of system events. Vehicle data are collected and accumulated by the system and are used for reporting and for performing incident detection and access control.',\n",

They are being actively developed and installed as environment-friendly energy sources because they are more energy efficient and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. This paper describes the development of CGSs for telecommunications and data communications centers. The system design of a CGS should be optimized considering the electrical and heat requirements. For buildings that need both electricity and a lot of cooling for equipment, we developed a CGS with highly efficient cooling. For buildings that might need a lot of electricity and less heat, on the other hand, we developed a combined-cycle CGS having a steam turbine generator driven by the steam produced from the waste heat of exhaust gas.',\n",

Specifically, a theoretical framework is developed to identify the sets of tool characteristics, collectively referred to as levels, which are proposed to support different modes of learning and learning processes. In addition, extensions to the 41 organizational learning process model (Crossan et al., 1999) are proposed, specific to searching and learning on the Web: 1) adding a fifth process - information foraging and search term development, and 2) adding a fourth level to the learning process - machine-level. Understanding which types of tools are useful in different learning contexts has implications for learning effectiveness and may help firms understand how to 'manage' their learning (Zack, 2005).\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"The growth of vehicle electrification is driven by the desire to reduce environmental pollution, and it is fueled by advancements in battery technology. If left unmanaged, electric vehicle (EV) charging will increase peak demand and put a strain on the electricity networks. However, if properly managed, EVs can provide useful services to the power system operator such as fast active-power injection which serves to improve the system frequency response (SFR) after a disturbance. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact that clusters of EVs, connected to frequency-responsive charging stations, have on the provision of SFR after a loss of generation event. The assessment considers EV charging demand in Great Britain (GB) for the year 2025 considering three different daily charging patterns. A generic model for the EV clusters is developed which includes the effects of measurement delays and control charger time response. The model and scenarios are integrated into a single-area model representative of the GB power system and the minimum expected values for the system's inertia in the year 2025 are used. The results obtained highlight the benefits on the SFR of utilizing EVs as a dynamic energy storage system for different types of charging and the impact of the measurement delay on the dynamics of the response.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'In increasingly populated urban areas, the optimization of energy resources is of vital importance not only for economic and ethical reasons, but also to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial plants and factories usually located around cities often require (and in some case also dissipate) large amounts of energy. As known, the waste heat generated by high-temperature industrial processes can be partially recovered for a variety of applications. Unfortunately, cost and efficiency issues limit the feasibility of some of these solutions. In this paper two possible waste heat recovery strategies are described and compared, i.e. electrical generation based on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and District Heating (DH). The proposed analysis focuses on the recovery of the waste heat produced by foundries and it relies on the experimental data collected in a real case study. Several simulation results, based on such experimental data sets, enable a reasonably fair comparison between these two heat recovery strategies, thus paving the way to the deployment of a demonstrator at SCM Foundries, Rimini, Italy.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"In an innovative engineering course on Sustainable Design in Engineering, two Rowan University electrical and computer engineering (ECE) students designed a prototype for an inexpensive power measurement instrument. Their motivation was to more economically and conveniently monitor the energy flows on a university campus that currently uses over $7 million of electricity and gas annually. These students continued the development of their initial design prototyped for the above course by redesigning, constructing, and testing a more easily manufacturable instrument in their Senior Engineering Clinic class. The engineering clinic sequence at Rowan University represents an ideal mechanism for the inclusion of key instrumentation and measurement (I&M) concepts and principles into an engineer's education. While the core ECE curriculum does not teach I&M technology (I&MT) as a distinct subject area, the students engage in a hands-on and minds-on learning environment in this clinic, which proves ideal for I&MT applications and education. Their challenge was to create an inexpensive I&MT that could provide the means by which Rowan University could affordably monitor its electrical energy use in many of its unmetered buildings. With these data, the university could then find out exactly why it leads a group of 20 peer universities and colleges in energy consumenergy consumption ption per square foot and to assist the university in meeting its sustainability commitment to the Governor's Office and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. With the assistance of their professor and the use of their electrical engineering training, the team undertook to develop an energy auditor's dream machine, i.e., a cheap, portable, and easily installed energy measurement instrument that produces reliable data and can be used to safely instrument each key building without requiring the aid of a professional electrician. This paper details the background of their challenge, the approaches they considered, the benefits of this project-based learning clinic on I&M education and, quite importantly, the innovation they have created, i.e., a single-phase power sensing, measuring, and monitoring instrument for a total cost of less than $100 (their design can be easily expanded to three phase for a nominal increase in sensor cost).\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"This paper provides the global, strategic and market analyses that show, by actual example, the potential synergism between wind and nuclear energy systems. By adopting a balanced portfolio of electricity and hydrogen production that is market driven, a generation mix of advanced nuclear designs with supplementary wind power provides a route towards a secure, sustainable and safe energy future Primary energy supply is on the threshold of a revolution as profound as utilization of carbon-based fuels by the Industrial Revolution. Improved energy efficiency is insufficient to bring CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under control since the new revolution must cope with rapid expansion of energy demand in the economies of the Developing World as they climb toward Developed World levels of wealth. Three broad options exist for acceptable, primary energy supply: nuclear, renewables, and carbon with sequestration. From all of these, energy will emerge increasingly as electricity and require some form of storage. Hydrogen is ideal both for storage of electricity and as a transportation fuel producing minimal greenhouse gas emissions. The required scale of new primary energy deployment is so large that choosing between the three supply technologies is pointless: one should identify ways in which they can most effectively be blended. NuWindcopy is one such blend. It addresses the problem of wind's short-term and seasonal intermittency and unpredictability. The extent to which wind's variability can be absorbed as electricity depends on the mix of other generation capacity on a power grid but wind power can usually contribute only a fairly small percentage before the need for back-up capacity becomes burdensome. This has led to the suggestion of converting wind-generated electricity into hydrogen by electrolysis. However, simple analysis shows that wind's low average output inflates the cost of electrolysis equipment beyond economic competitiveness. With NuWind, judicious application of time-of-day variability in the value of electricity subsidizes the cost of electrolytic equipment. When the value of electricity is high, electricity is sold to the grid. When the value of electricity to the grid is low, electricity from both nuclear and wind sources are converted into hydrogen using cells designed to handle varying current density. If the wind is blowing, the current to the electrolysis cells is turned up. Low-cost cavern storage for hydrogen accommodates seasonal swings in the wind component. Using hourly electricity price data from Ontario and Alberta and typical hourly wind data, the economics of large-scale hydrogen production by NuWind are shown to be comparable with those of steam-methane reforming with sequestration. Over a wide range of electricity to hydrogen ratios, the estimated cost of bulk, undistributed hydrogen production by Nu Wind is below the US DOE's target of 2000 $/tonne (all dollars quoted are U.S.). All nuclear and aeolian generation is always available to the grid at times of high demand.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning(HVAC) systems perform environmental regulations to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality. Recently optimization based Model Predictive Control (MPC) has shown promising results to improve energy efficiency of HVAC system in smart buildings. However rigorous studies on incorporating data driving comfort requirement into the MPC framework are lacking. Previous research on comfort learning usually ignores the restrictions of the downstream control and merely focuses on utilizing existing machine learning tools, which induce undesirable non-linear coupling in decision variables. In this work, we adopt a novel \"learning for application\" scheme. The idea is to describe user comfort zone by a Convex Piecewise Linear Classifier (CPLC), which is directly pluggable for the optimization in MPC. We analyze the theoretical generalization performance of the classifier and propose a cost sensitive large margin learning formulation. The learning problem is then solved by online stochastic gradient descent with Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) initialization. Experimental results on publicly available comfort data set validates the performance of CPLC and the training algorithm. HVAC MPC case studies show that the proposed method enables much better exploitation and seamless integration of individual comfort requirement in the MPC framework.',\n",

In fact, some of the most impressive advantages of using geo-spatial data are derived from the power of bringing together geographic data covering territories that may well be administered by different organizations and from layering geographic data with other social and demographic data sets. However, building the GIT infrastructure necessary for interoperability and integration has been very challenging. Technical capabilities are available, but organizational, institutional and political factors are seen as powerful barriers. Using structuration theory, this paper argues that the World Trade Center crisis was a catalyst for a change in the conceptualization of GIT for emergency response and, consequently, much was learned about interoperability and inter-organizational geographic information systems.',\n",

Rooftops of buildings are feasible options to utilize solar energy in urban area. This paper presents an object-based method to locate the appropriate sites for setting solar panels using airborne LiDAR data in downtown area. The method consists of following five steps: (I) Analyzing the influence of urban three dimensional morphology on the variations of solar radiation. (II) Automated extraction of building footprints. (III) Segmentation of roof planes. (IV) Derivation attributes of each roof plane, such as roof plane area, average slope, average aspect, yearly average total solar radiation intensity. (V) Selection of suitable locations for solar panels with the comprehensive evaluation of area, slope, aspect and yearly average solar radiation intensity. The method of locating suitable sites of solar panels has been implemented as an ArcGIS extension module, and has been applied for the suitable location decision of solar panels over the Lujiazui region located in downtown Shanghai, P. R. China. This research provides a useful tool for the solar utilization potential analysis and could draw the attention of the research community.',\n",

However, this demands more power and results in environmental pollution. As a solution, directional modulation can be used to provide efficient and interference-free communications. In this work, we geometrically model the extended detection regions of M-QAM modulation for M = 4, 8, 16, 32 and use these modeled regions to design energy efficient symbol-level precoders for an interference-free MIMO directional modulation transceiver. We formulate and transform the precoder design problems into linearly constrained quadratic programming optimization problems. The simulation results show that compared with the benchmark schemes, directional modulation results in lower power consumption and symbol error rate using the less stringent extended detection regions and interference-free capability, respectively.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Traditionally small and medium scale industries (SMIs) have concentrated on physical resources but have often neglected the effective management information, though realisation of its importance is now growing. This requires fast and accurate computation and manipulation of huge amount of data. Information system can be used for energy and environmental planning and to reduce the energy wastage and environmental pollution. SMI's in India mostly cater the domestic market and use local sources. These industries are mostly labour intensive. Managerial and entrepreneurial skills are less, with limited access to information and financial sources. These limitations make it difficult for SMIs to upgrade their technologies and allocate their resources efficiently. This work examines possible implementation of information system based energy and environmental management system in selected SMIs. Some of the important factors identified to develop a model for this system are energy consumption, energy standards (benchmarks), emission generation, environmental standards and production details for various sections in a foundry. The application case study to highlight the benefits of energy and environment technology option for foundry is described in this paper.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Capturing and modeling 3D information of the built environment is a big challenge. A number of techniques and technologies are now in use. These include EDM, GPS and photogrammetric application and also remote sensing applications. In this paper, we discussed 3D laser scanning technology, which can acquire high density point data in a accurate, fast way. Therefore, it can provide benefits for refurbishment process in the built environment. The scanner can digitize all the 3D information concerned with a building down to millimetre detail. A series of scans externally and internally allows an accurate 3D model of the building to be produced. This model can be \"sliced\" through different planes to produce accurate 2D plans and elevations. This novel technology improves the efficiency and quality of construction projects, such as maintenance of buildings or group of buildings that are going to be renovated for new services. Although data capture is more efficient using laser scanner than most other techniques, data modeling still presents significant research problems. These are addressed in this paper. The paper describes the research undertaken in the EU funded (FP6 IP) INTELCITIES project concerning 3D laser scanner technology for CAD modeling and its integration with various systems such as 3D printing and VR projection systems. It also considers research to be undertaken in the EU funded (INTERREG) virtual environmental planning systems (VEPS) project in the next 2 years. Following this, an approach for data modeling of scanned data is introduced, through which the information belonging to existing buildings can be stored in a database to use in building, urban, and regional scale models.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'In the U.S., commercial and residential buildings and their occupants consume more than 40% of total energy and are responsible for 45% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, saving energy and costs, improving energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions are key initiatives in many cities and municipalities and for building owners and operators. To reduce energy consumption in buildings, one needs to understand patterns of energy usage and heat transfer as well as characteristics of building structures, operations and occupant behaviors that influence energy consumption. We develop heat transfer inverse models and statistical models that describe how energy is consumed in commercial buildings, and simulate the impact of energy saving changes that can be made to commercial buildings including structural, operational, behavioral and weather changes, on energy consumption and GHG emissions. The analytic toolset identifies energy savings opportunities and quantifies the savings for a large portfolio of public buildings.',\n",

This paper examines an approach for designing tools to support the operations staff of a HALIFAX Class frigate in building and maintaining an integrated tactical picture. It is based on developing models of picture compilation work to permit formulating a model of support for data and information fusion aids. Aspects of the work being modeled include the dynamic information processing in individual operators' picture compilation tasks, the information flow and integration among the operator team, and their goals for acquiring and maintaining situation awareness.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Electric vehicle (EV) numbers are expected to significantly increase in the coming years reflecting their potential to reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Charging such vehicles will impose additional demands on the electricity network but given the pattern of vehicle usage, the possibility exists to discharge the stored energy back to the grid when required, for example when lower than expected wind generation is available. Such vehicle-to-grid operation could see vehicle owners supplying the grid if they are rewarded for providing such services. This paper describes a model of an electric vehicle storage system integrated with a standardized power system (the IEEE 30-node power system model). A decision-making strategy is established for the deployment of the battery energy stored, taking account of the state of charge, time of day, electricity prices and vehicle charging requirements. Applying empirical data, the benefits to the network in terms of load balancing and the energy and cost savings available to the vehicle owner are analyzed. The results show that for the case under study, the EVs have only a minor impact on the network in terms of distribution system losses and voltage regulation but more importantly the vehicle owner's costs are roughly halved.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'This study focuses on the way urban dynamic processes challenge existing monitoring approaches and how urban structure types (UST) support an effective urban management. Due to their microstructure and the instability of shape, the differentiation of settlement structures is substantially difficult. Hence, highly sophisticated data such as color infrared (CIR) orthophotos as well as methods of image analysis, e.g., segmentation of objects will be employed. It will be shown how an object-oriented analysis strategy with CIR aerial photographs can be used to detect and discriminate different urban structure types by describing typical characteristics of color, texture, shape, and context. The urban structure classification is characterized by identifying different types of buildings (different types of housing, industrial buildings, infrastructure) and open spaces (woodland, community gardens, parks), their structural composition in terms of the amount, connectivity, and distribution of impervious surfaces, green spaces, and other open spaces on an aggregated neighborhood scale. This investigation contributes to a transferable methodology to monitor the urban dynamics and structure on a local level.',\n",

In this paper, we investigate how to minimize the long-term energy cost of dynamic Internet-scale systems by fully exploiting the energy efficiency in geographic diversity and variation over time. To this end, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem by considering the fundamental uncertainties of Internet-scale systems, such as the dynamic data. We develop a dynamic request mapping algorithm to solve the formulated problem, which balances the tradeoff between energy cost and delay performance. Our designed algorithm makes real-time decisions based on current queue backlogs and system states, and does not require any knowledge of stochastic job arrivals and service rates caused by dynamic data queries. We formally prove the optimality of our approach. Extensive trace-driven simulations verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the baseline strategies with respect to system cost, queue backlogs, and delay.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"The fast change from the old meters to the modern smart metering systems implies the adoption of new philosophies and new behaviors, both on the side of the electricity consumer and on the side of the energy chain. Real-time information available at a large scale opens new possibilities to manage the electricity consume and losses, to use energy more efficiently, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to save money. This is why the implementation of the new smart metering technologies is supported by the European legislation and by the different stakeholders. After a short overview of the smart metering systems, the paper presents the challenges of the smart metering implementation in Romania. The possible benefits and risks resulted from the roll-out report are emphasized. The need of a smart environment is discussed. The elements at the interface with the meter should be \\u201csmart\\u201d enough to be able to make use of the meter's smartness. On the consumer's side, there is also a problem of acceptance, which makes things more delicate. Consumers need time to learn, understand, accept and use the new facilities. Aiming the maximization of benefits and minimization of risks, the paper suggests a step-by-step implementation of the smart metering functionalities.\",\n",

Fulfilling such diverse needs requires the integration of renewable energy resources on a large scale. However, the existing information and communication infrastructure controlling the corresponding power grids and components is not directly designed to master the ever increasing complexity. An upcoming requirement is the need for the functional adaption of the control systems during operation. The main aim of this article is to discuss and analyze requirements as well as to introduce a standard-compliant concept for a reconfigurable software architecture used in intelligent electronic devices for distributed and renewable energy resources. A simulation case study shows the applicability of this approach. A secure adaptation of the functional structure and the corresponding algorithms in device controllers can substantially contribute to a more efficient energy system, while at the same time responding to future needs.',\n",

Metals play a key role in Enabling Sustainability through societies various high-tech applications. However, the resources of our planet are limited, as is the strain to which we can subject it in terms of emissions, pollution, and disposal of waste. For these reasons, finding ways to lower the environmental footprint of our collective existence and therefore lowering greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change is a vital priority ([1], [2]). The maximization of resource efficiency [3] is the principal theme of this contribution. It will be shown in depth the detail that is required to systemically fully understand resource efficiency in the context of material use, illustrating this by example of E-waste recycling. The opportunities and limits of recycling are discussed with a specific emphasis on the physics and related economics of recycling. Through this Design for Resource Efficiency is elaborated on. In support of this, the detailed data that are required, the technological understanding and design rules are among others implicitly highlighted that impact on resource efficiency. Specifically the understanding of Product- Centric recycling is highlighted setting it apart from the usual Material-Centric recycling approaches (which focus more on bulk materials) and therefore inherently limit especially the maximal recovery of technologically critical elements - these limitations will be discussed.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'With the advent of cloud computing, storage and computing functions are migrating to remote resources such as virtual servers and storage systems which are mostly hosted in the data centers. This migration can ensure significant energy savings as utilization of local resources contribute to 40% of the Greenhouse Gas emissions of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). On the other hand, provisioning of the cloud services needs to be handled carefully since energy consumption of the transport network, as well as the energy consumed by the data centers, is expected to increase. We revisit our previously proposed Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models that are used to reconfigure the cloud network design with look-ahead demand profile. Due to long runtimes of the MILP models in large-scale scenarios, in this paper, we propose two heuristics to reconfigure the cloud network for provisioning the cloud and Internet computing demands. The first heuristic aims to minimize the propagation delay while the second one targets minimizing the power consumption of the data centers and the transport network. We verify the heuristics through simulations where MILP models are used as the benchmarks. Numerical results show that power minimized provisioning can guarantee significant energy savings in the cloud network with less resource consumption. We also present the energy versus delay trade-off and point out possible solutions.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Ambient energy harvesting has emerged as a promising technique to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions for green wireless communications. Energy management for throughput maximization under random energy arrivals has been studied extensively in energy harvesting relay communication networks with either finite-size data buffer or finite-size energy storage. However, the problem is still open when the energy harvesting relay node is subject to both finite-size data and energy storage. In this paper, we study the transmission policy of joint time scheduling and power allocation under a transmission deadline, which maximizes the end-to-end system throughput in a two-hop relay communication network where the energy harvesting relay node is equipped with finite-size data buffer and battery. In particular, we first formulate the throughput maximization problem as a convex optimization problem under an offline optimization framework, and obtain the optimal offline time scheduling and power allocation by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions based on the full knowledge of energy arrivals and channel states. Then, we formulate the throughput maximization problem as a stochastic dynamic programming problem under the online optimization framework, and obtain the optimal online time scheduling and power allocation by solving a series of convex optimizations based on the casual knowledge of energy arrivals and channel states. Finally, to reduce the computation complexity, we further propose two suboptimal online transmission policies. Numerical results show the impacts of battery capacity and buffer size on the maximum throughput of the proposed policies, as well as the balance between the spectrum efficiency and the delay sensitivity.',\n",

Typically they undertake multiple projects with limited multiple resources and information. Most importantly they need to take continuous and quick decisions to keep it going. The reason behind this is lack of tools and structured approach that can efficiently deal with multi-project environment (PME). Resulting is problem of wrong project selection, project slippage and under/over utilization of scares resources. This paper presents a simulation model (OPMPE) for optimizing MPE. The model is capable of analyzing and predicting future problems, assessing the cumulative impact and generates valuable statistics and information for quick decision-making. It will work together with the available scheduling tools and will help strengthening the overall planning and execution system for MPE. The application and of the model is demonstrated using a collection of real project data for building construction.',\n",

Its extension to the real time environment, however, imposes the additional constraint of timing predictability, which requires a bounded overhead for managing redundancy. The paper discusses the trade-off between reducing system overhead and increasing (temporal) consistency between the primary and backup, and explores ways to optimize such a system to minimize either the inconsistency or the system overhead while maintaining the temporal consistency guarantees of the system. An implementation built on top of the existing RTPB model (H. Zou and F. Jahanian, 1998) was developed within the x-kernel architecture on the Mach OSF platform running MK 7.2.

Since a significant part of the cost of operating AVWC systems is energy consumption, we have started a project, together with a company that builds and installs such systems, with the aim of applying constraint programming technology to schedule the daily emptying sequences of the drop off points in such a way that energy consumption is minimized. In this paper we describe how the problem of deciding the drop off points that should be emptied at a given time can be modeled as a constraint integer programming (CIP) problem. Moreover, we report on experiments using real data from AVWC systems installed in different cities that provide empirical evidence that CIP offers a suitable technology for reducing energy consumption in AVWC.',\n",

Hence, it becomes important to investigate what impact a given PHEV introduction level has on load profiles due to expected charging behavior of residents. This paper proposes a new model for generating PHEV home-charging patterns by combining PHEV usage with synthetic activity generation of residents' electricity-dependent activities. The synthetic activity data are simulated based on time-use data collected in time diaries, and define the basis for calculations of the PHEV home-charging behavior as well as the resident's electricity consumption. The proposed model is generic and can be used where similar residential time-use data are available. Based on the underlying activities, the model estimates the total load profile due to residential load as well as the variation in the load profile. The resulting load profiles can be used in load shaving studies in order to investigate what type of activities, PHEV usage or other, may be moved to hours with lower demand.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"In today's network environments the integrated design and management of different security technologies and mechanisms are of great interest. Especially in large networks, the security management should be supported by approaches with an appropriate level of abstraction, such that a system can be considered independently of the complex configuration details of its various component mechanisms. Furthermore, the employment of the security services and the design of their configurations should be supported by a structured technique that separates the consideration of the system as a whole from the detailed design of the subsystems. Pursuing these goals, this papers offers an approach to modeling network security systems, based on the concepts of policy-based management and model-based management, and analyzes the policy representation and refinement as well as the model validation enabled by this modeling.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"The volume of traffic carried on the Optical Transport Network (OTN) is continuously growing, not only due to the increase of new services, new applications, and the number of both connected users and smart devices, but also owing to the rapidly growing Data Center Interconnect (DCI) market. As a result, telecom operators need to upgrade their transport networks to cope with these new traffic requirements. This tremendous increase in bandwidth demand will also introduce energy bottlenecks in OTNs. The telecommunication networks' significant Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE) is another challenge that must be addressed in OTN design and planning policies. Thus, energy-efficient OTN architectures are currently attracting the attention of telecom operators. The candidate OTN architectures are: (1) the conventional Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) fixed grid with high Single Line Rates (SLRs); (2) the conventional DWDM fixed grid adopting Mixed Line Rates (MLRs); and (3) the Elastic Optical Network (EON) or flexigrid-based architecture which is enabled by the Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (O-OFDM) technique. This paper evaluates the power consumption of the abovementioned OTN architectures under different traffic loads and patterns, as well as different network physical topologies. In order to perform the evaluation, new heuristic algorithms are specifically developed for the green design and planning of data center optical interconnects.\",\n",

These principles are well established in quality circles and they apply in a very positive way to our sustainable green engineering effort. This tutorial focuses on process modeling use cases and more green engineering challenges and solutions. It begins by reviewing the key sustainable green process modeling use case challenges, and provides some solutions. The fundamental reason why we must deal with sustainable green process modeling is that we would like to iron out waste, perform plant wide optimization to iron out all the waste that we have in our organizations, in our systems, in our factories, in our plants.  Ultimately, our goal is to have sustainable, cleaner, safer and more energy efficient machine design production. ',\n",

MRV systems for emission reporting for voluntary carbon agreements and REDD will require the careful integration of remotely sensed (RS) data and ground measurements for the retrieval of C and \\u0394C with sufficient precision and accuracy to be marketable and tradable. MRV systems will also need to be designed specific to scale; from project level monitoring for voluntary carbon agreements to national level REDD reporting. Field sampling will be an expensive component of MRV systems and efficiency and cost effectiveness are paramount. Here we present protocols that can guide the design of field measurement campaigns for estimating C and \\u0394C for MRV systems in developing tropical countries. We will use examples from Papua New Guinea (PNG).',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Data reporting strategy in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks can be differentiated based on task-specific data gathering requirements. This paper presents a novel QoS-aware data report scheduling scheme, called QRS, that offers task-specific sensor node classification and class-based data reporting in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. The QRS scheme performs two-phase scheduling algorithms to provide differentiated quality of service (QoS) to sensor nodes in different classes. In the first phase, time slots are divided into each data reporting round, defined for each class while, in the second phase, the sensor nodes in the same class will be allocated to particular schedules. The predefined number of sensor nodes, which are based on the class that the sensors belongs to, are assigned to the time slot(s). The QRS scheme is scalable as it is operated in a distributed manner and not limited to a specific channel access mechanism such as contention-based and schedule-based channel access.',\n",

In these high-rise buildings, the intelligent control provides energy efficient means for comfort, safety, and security. Real-time occupancy-based control for HVAC is greatly contributing to energy savings, in addition to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint. This paper proposes an improved architecture using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2FLS) for adaptive control of multi-zone shared spaces in intelligent buildings in respect of user comfort and energy efficiency for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The objective is the improvement in occupant comfort levels. From the simulation results obtained the suitability of IT2FLS to handle the uncertainties related to dynamically varying occupancy patterns is illustrated. Work can be extended to develop a cognitive controller for reducing the dependency on the operator skills for optimized high level control settings.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'A pilot Web site study for comparative exploration of heritage landscapes and great European gardens has raised issues about the size and complexity of the datasets and the need to record locational and other metadata with visual and aural images. Such multimedia datasets deployed from spatial databases are likely to become served on demand with appropriate associated detail and data. Previous work on the Tower of London and its environs has shown that similar large complex datasets are increasingly common during the creation and management of 3D models of buildings and urban areas. Such datasets may also encompass digital video and high-resolution images, historical images and data, with maintenance and management information and record drawings. Little difference has been found in practice between the data management and retrieval issues that apply to Web-based multimedia interpretations of historic environments and those that are particular to large area 3D models. A common approach may serve an initial Web site based outcome and also assist later development of a virtual reality 3D model. The question of when it is useful to model and when video or high-resolution images may be equally or more useful is also examined.',\n",

Through building the trustworthy model between distributed system and user behaviors, constructing the architecture of trustworthiness distributed systems, intensifying the survivability of services, and strengthening the manageability of distributed systems, the secure problem of distributed systems is to be radically solved. By setting up the trustworthy computing circumstance and supplying the trustworthy validation and the active protection based on identity and behavior for trustworthy distributed system, we will reach the goal of defending the unaware viruses and in break. This research insists that the security, controllability, manageability, and survivability should be basic properties of a trustworthy distributed system.

The efficient memory management can make the retention of memory and knowledge retrieval easier.

Accordingly in this paper we adopt the theory relating short-term memory, long-term memory and forgetting and propose the intelligent knowledge system with the hierarchical associative memory managed by storage management strategy. It has the function of adaptive learning, selective processing, perception, inference and data extraction. This model is applied to the medical area and tested with symptom data.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'There is an ever increasing demand for environmental management of buildings, office automation, security monitoring or remote control of customer appliances and remote meter reading. The AC low voltage power line would be an ideal communications medium for digital data. Several systems for power line communications (PLC) were presented. The reliability of PLC is strongly influenced by time-variant and frequency-selective attenuation and interference on the power line channel. Various experiments were made to evaluate different PLC systems and set up a channel model. This paper gives a short summary of typical transfer characteristics and interference to be observed at power line networks. It is shown that at transmission over a single phase of the power supply system the maximum phase jitter of the time-variant transfer function is in most cases below 90/spl deg/. In the second part important modulation schemes are evaluated for applicability to power line communications. This evaluation considers chirp modulation, direct sequencing phase shift keying modulation (PN/PSK) and hopping techniques with spectral redundancy given by carriers with M different frequencies. The selection of the optimal modulation technique considers the European standard EN 50065, which restricts both the frequency range and the maximum signal amplitude. This paper deals with modulation schemes, using M frequencies, namely classic frequency hopping modulation (MFH) and the multifrequency,phase modulation (MFH/PSK and MF/PSK). Significant advantages of M frequency phase modulation in comparison with classic frequency hopping are pointed out.',\n",

The proposed method first generates the georeferenced feature image of a mobile LiDAR point cloud and then uses image segmentation to extract contour areas which contain facade points of buildings, points of trees, and points of other objects in the georeferenced feature image. After all the points in each contour area are extracted, a classification based on principal component analysis (PCA) method is adopted to identify building objects from point clouds extracted in contour areas. Then, all the points in a building object are segmented into different planes using the random sample consensus algorithm. For each building, points in facade planes are chosen to calculate the direction, the start point, and the end point of the facade footprints using PCA. Finally, footprints of different facades of building are refined, harmonized, and joined. Two data sets of downtown areas and one data set of a residential area captured by Optech's LYNX mobile mapping system were tested to verify the validities of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a promising and valid solution for automatically extracting building facade footprints from mobile LiDAR point clouds.\",\n",

Since information concerning these constraints are unknown in an environment, a reinforcement learning approach is proposed to solve this problem.

It estimates the benefit of exploration by value of information therefore avoids the error-prone process of parameter tuning which usually requires human intervention.

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Measuring the operating conditions of buildings' components is generally applied to technical systems for improving the energy and environmental management, especially exploiting the IoT functions. However, the measuring and connectivity capabilities are not largely applied to the building envelope. This paper presents the development of a sensing and control system integrated into prefabricated envelope elements, with the functionalities typical of an IoT system. In fact, the Smart-IoT fa\\xe7ade is based on the idea of transforming the buildings' fa\\xe7ade into a IoT device, capable of communicating with external actors: building owner/manager, building management systems or local controller. Given the importance of the fa\\xe7ade as interface between indoor and outdoor environments, the possibility of having real-time data on the envelope operating conditions, is significant to improve the building operation, in terms of comfort and energy efficiency, enabling the adaptive or intelligent fa\\xe7ade concept. To this aim, the RenoZEB project is developing a plug&play fa\\xe7ade module for building renovation, with embedded sensors and actuators. The module with the sensing architecture is completely assembled off-site, reducing the amount of work to be done onsite. Once installed and configured, the module sends data to a IoT platform, that makes them available for third parties. Different configurations of sensors/actuators can be developed. Among them, this paper presents a solution to optimize the control of windows' shadings. Thus, the fa\\xe7ade sensing system has been integrated with an advanced controller that aims at optimizing the shadings position to provide the maximum comfort but allowing the right amount of solar radiation to pass through the windows.\",\n",

In a typical cross docking system, the primary objective is to eliminate storage and excessive handling. As companies continue to streamline distribution functions, cross docking is becoming a more widely accepted distribution method. The benefits of cross docking include reduced inventory, increased customer responsiveness, and better control of the distribution operation. By definition, cross docking systems require: a close connection between receiving and shipping operations This connection calls for robust hardware and software systems to solve the cross docking problem. Simulation reduces some of the risk involved with cross docking systems. The paper describes how simulation helps ensure success in cross docking systems by determining optimal hardware configuration and software control, as well as establishing failure strategies before cross docking problems are encountered. Modeling methods and issues are also discussed as they apply to cross docking. The paper is oriented toward simulation practitioners who need to model cross docking systems, as well as distribution managers who are evaluating cross docking.',\n",

To have an overview of the current state-of-the-art of SD use in the eGovernment field; we have surveyed related literature. Our main goal is to uncover the possibilities for future research by clarifying the shortages. The identified literature is not very large. In most of the literature, SD models use was limited to SD practitioners. We discovered low usage of Group Model Building and workshops despite their usefulness in involving non-SD practitioners in the model building process. Additionally, there is a large untapped potential in using Interactive Learning Environment, in spite of its importance in involving non-technical users in conducting what-if scenario testing, and changing users' mental models by uncovering the underlying system structure.\",\n",

We propose an exploration method based on the use of the sensorial data provided by an omnidirectional stereoscopic vision system. First, we link the problem of sensorial model construction with two omnidirectional images. We propose an approach based on the fusion of several criteria, which is realized according to Dempster-Shafer rules. We then deal with the matching problem of the stereo sensorial model with an environment map integrating all the previous primitive observations. We propose two matching approaches based on different selection criteria: the Hausdorff distance and the cumulated Cartesian distance. We also present our incremental map building paradigm based on the hypothesis of a non a priori knowledge. Finally, we deal with the problem of allowing a robot to localize itself and to construct concurrently a representation of its environment.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Fuel cells are a promising power source for future data centers, offering high energy efficiency, low greenhouse gas emissions, and high reliability. However, due to mechanical limitations related to fuel delivery, fuel cells are slow to adjust to sudden increases in data center power demands, which can result in temporary power shortfalls. To mitigate the impact of power shortfalls, prior work has proposed to either perform power capping by throttling the servers, or to leverage energy storage devices (ESDs) that can temporarily provide enough power to make up for the shortfall while the fuel cells ramp up power generation. Both approaches have disadvantages: power capping conservatively limits server performance and can lead to service level agreement (SLA) violations, while ESD-only solutions must significantly overprovision the energy storage device capacity to tolerate the shortfalls caused by the worst-case (i.e., largest) power surges, which greatly increases the total cost of ownership (TCO). We propose SizeCap, the first ESD sizing framework for fuel cell powered data centers, which coordinates ESD sizing with power capping to enable a cost-effective solution to power shortfalls in data centers. SizeCap sizes the ESD just large enough to cover the majority of power surges, but not the worst-case surges that occur infrequently, to greatly reduce TCO. It then uses the smaller capacity ESD in conjunction with power capping to cover the power shortfalls caused by the worst-case power surges. As part of our new flexible framework, we propose multiple power capping policies with different degrees of awareness of fuel cell and workload behavior, and evaluate their impact on workload performance and ESD size. Using traces from Microsoft's production data center systems, we demonstrate that SizeCap significantly reduces the ESD size (by 85%ofor a workload with infrequent yet large power surges, and by 50% for a workload with frequent power surges) without violating any SLAs.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u'Master-planning in general, more particularly 3Dinterpretative visualisation of Master-plans, has not been the norm in the UK planning process. However the advent of the new Localism Bill, proceeding through the UK parliament, gives some indication that these will become much more common in English practice. It is argued that English planning departments will need to move towards implementing 3D Planning constraint exploration tools and standards for which they have little experience. In German planning in particular there have been many initiatives that point the way towards standards for master plan visualisation. SmartCodes in the US indicate a similar approach for regulatory checking. The Localism Bill is likely also to require substantial inclusive consultation and collaboration with neighbourhood groups. Tools for inclusive collaborative engagement were trialled in the VEPs Interreg IIIB project. This paper predicts that the combination of these or similar approaches will become necessary to cope with the demand.',\n",

On the other hand, wind energy as an alternative to thermal power plants is a clean source of energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions, wastewaters and solid waste, and last but not least, there is no fuel requirement for WindPark. The percentage of participation of RES in the total consumption of final energy by 2020 in Macedonia should be equal to 21%. Following the principle of the promotion of sustainable regional and environmental development as direct implementation of EU policies, the aim of the study presented in this paper is to deliver a framework for spatial planning and sustainable development by detecting the potential areas for investment in wind energy sources. The study presented in this paper promotes eight potential locations for building of wind parks, presents the requirements and procedures to local and international investors, and facilitates the building of wind parks in a very short time. The evaluation of the impact analyses that wind parks may have on the environment and to offer possible mitigation techniques, this study presents the results of the detailed analysis for selection of potential locations for building of wind parks by mapping of: potential number of wind generators on selected wind parks sites; locations of neighbouring objects which might cause interaction and the effect of cumulative influence; the impact of sound emission (in terms of loudness) to local population; energy connection to existing or new energy infrastructure (layout of lines, location of substations); ground transportation and traffic infrastructure; geological aspects (terrain stability, erosion of the soil); seismological activity of the terrain, conformity of urban planning with respect to protection of natural disasters, protection of cultural and historic heritage; touristic regions, zones and locations; biological diversity including the fatalities of birds and bats from collisions with wind turbines; etc. In addition, software Arc GIS is applied also for analysis of the crossing points with respect to the existing and planned transmission power lines on 110 kV, 220 kV and 400 kV, but also with proposed oil-pipeline AMBO, constructed oil-pipeline Thessaloniki-Skopje, new proposed route of the pipeline, by applying safety measures and minimum allowed distance.',\n",

Ontology is a basic building concept for semantic Web and ontology language such as RDF/RDF schema is a basic tool for constructing ontology system. One of the major points when constructing ontology with RDF/RDF schema is versioning because ontology knowledge is not static but change as times go by. Therefore, ontology systems should provide versioning skills which reflect changes in domain, changes of data concept, and changes of relations between data resources. This paper discusses the problems of RDF schema versioning and provide storage structure and management skills for RDF schema versioning in RDB environment. We introduce version graph and transitivity rule which is used for version selection for some data. Finally, we introduce a storage structure for implementing the versioning scheme\",\n",

The objective is to create an environment that will enable sharing and reuse of models and will promote collaborative work on models. Because of their widespread use in organizations, we focus on spreadsheet models to illustrate our concepts. We begin by discussing the various kinds of knowledge about models that should be stored in this knowledge base and how such knowledge could be captured and stored on a corporate Intranet. Next, we describe how one could use Structured Modeling (SM) as the framework for organizing the knowledge contained in the spreadsheet models per se. We propose capturing the model schema graphically using a generic structure diagram. A spreadsheet consistent with the model schema would be generated automatically. The individual who is building the spreadsheet model would be asked to supply details (data and functional relationships). He or she would be free to modify the physical appearance of the spreadsheet in any way that did not violate the relationships shown in the diagram. Finally, we describe the architecture of a system that would store, retrieve, and distribute the models and modeling knowledge to users. This description includes a discussion about the distribution of the functionality between the client, the server and the middle layers. We also provide some references to existing tools that could be used to capture the various types of knowledge that we have identified.',\n",

In this paper, a new GIS-T data model is presented for urban traffic incidents management. Based on object-oriented method and Unified Modeling Language (UML), the proposed model is built by extending and amending ArcGIS transportation data model (UNETRANS). In the meantime, in view of the limitations of current linear reference system used in transportation application, an urban known buildings based linear reference system (UKBLRS) is developed. UKBLRS is very easy to be understood by traffic engineers and common travelers, and it will increase the utility value of linear reference system in transportation system. With UKBLRS, the proposed data model can be used effectively in urban traffic incidents management system.',\n",

This paper investigated the optimization operation of a grid-connected CCHP microgrid, which consists of gas turbines, PVs, WTs, waste heat boilers, absorption refrigerating machines, electricity storage devices, and heat storage devices. The algorithm of chaotic partial swarm is used to determine the optimal operational condition of the CCHP microgrid. A numerical case study is carried out to illustrate the feasibility and accuracy of the adopted method. The simulation results show that the gas turbine almost supply the entire power load, which brings both economic and environmental benefits. In addition, the heat storage devices can also coordinate with the gas turbines to determine the optimal outputs, and consequently reducing energy losses and operational costs.',\n",

In addition to research, development, testing and use of renewable energies, it is also necessary to measure and track online, from a distance all the phenomena that occur. Due to the evolution of information and communications technologies, monitoring and control techniques, they need to be tested in practice before marketing. This ensures both scalability and interoperability, demonstrating the possibility of collecting, centralizing, analyzing energy consumption and CO2data. In this way, measurable character, data transparency, company acceptability, planning and visibility of renewable energy usage can be improved.

In addition to conventional power generation, renewable energy systems are being integrated to meet the rising demand of electrical power. To provide reliable, cost effective power solutions and to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions effectively renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal etc are more viable. The design of hybrid renewable energy system with battery backup has been proposed in this paper. For this hybrid system, the meteorological data of Solar Radiation, hourly wind speed for the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad, Jagityal (Latitude 18\\xb026' N, longitude is 79\\xb07'E) are taken to meet the primary load of 100Kwh/day, 28Kw peak load. The technical performance of each component has been evaluated and finally sensitivity analysis is performed to optimize the proposed system at different conditions. The local solar radiation, wind data and load were analyzed and simulated in HOMER to assess the technical and economic viability of the integrated system.\",\n",

The paper introduces the experimental environment, investigates the thermo-physical similarity of the two Test-Boxes, and deals with system identification related aspects. A simple third order state space model (SSM) is derived from first principles. This SSM served as a basis for the derivation of a structured SSM which is facilitated for parameter estimation by means of real measurement data. The performance of the structured SSM is validated with different identification data. The cross-validation performance decreases especially for longer validation intervals, however, within the MPC relevant prediction horizon the performance is still acceptable.',\n",

Texture analysis, which reveals spatial variations, was adopted to interpret the urban spatial patterns. Statistical and structural texture features were extracted from the SPOT image and evaluated for their capability of detailed mapping of urban structures. Supervised image classifications were performed on combinations of different texture features. The imagery was classified into: low-rise, old multi-storey, newer multi-storey and most-recent multistorey, high-rise, roads, construction sites, open water/vegetated and agricultural areas. The study shows that the classification accuracy of original SPOT imagery is only 46%. By using six textural channels, the accuracy has increased to 72%. The best classification shows the urban spatial pattern well.',\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"The 3D Trading Floor lets people use one of their strongest innate skills-spotting exceptions. A good visualization system leverages this ability by bringing exceptions to the fore. The model shows data on many different levels. Because it's designed for the floor operations staff, as opposed to individual traders, it focuses on operational issues. So it depicts the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in an abstracted style that corresponds to the physical layout. It shows each of the 17 trading posts and each stock traded. In addition to this micro level of detail, an external, macro level provides live TV feeds, such as Bloomberg, CNN, or CNBC, overlaid on the walls of the stadium-like world. At an intermediate level, it shows the NYSE's two data centers, local servers, and links between mainframes, servers, and trading posts. When something breaks, changes in colors, shapes, and motion pinpoint the problem area, as well as the probable causes and any downstream functions that are or may be lost.\",\n",

This study selects Harbin as the typical case and investigates what factors affect the amount of its carbon emission by applying the STIRPAT model with the data from 1995 to 2015. The findings show that urban population, energy intensity, per capita GDP deflator, and the capacity of public transportation all positively affected the level of city's carbon emissions with a gradually decreasing influencing extent, while industrial structure did not significantly affected carbon emissions. Accordingly, to reduce carbon emissions in Harbin, residential living environment, energy efficiency, and the energy system of public transportation should be further optimized.\",\n",

       " {'Query26': {u'abstract': u\"Virtual enterprises (YE) and workflow management systems (WFMS) require deployable and flexible infrastructures, promoting the integration of heterogenous resources and services, as well as the development of new VE business processes in terms of workflow (LVF) rules coordinating the activities of the VE's component enterprises. We argue that a suitable general-purpose coordination infrastructure may well fit the needs of VE management in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment like the Internet, by providing engineers with the abstractions and run-time support to address heterogeneity of different sorts, and to represent WF rules as coordination laws. We discuss the requirements for VE infrastructures, and suggest why VE management and WFMS may be seen as coordination problems. Then, we introduce the TuCSoN coordination model and technology, and show, both in principle and in a simple case study, how such a coordination infrastructure can support the design and development of VE's WFMS.\",\n",
