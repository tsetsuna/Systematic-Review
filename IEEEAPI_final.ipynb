Minor shifts in peak demand have major implications in terms of savings for both consumers and utilities. This study develops a cloud computing-based big data analytics framework for a building energy efficiency monitoring (BEEM) system that enables managers to facilitate efficient energy use in multiple residential buildings. The framework incorporates smart meter technology, remote sensing and monitoring, Bluetooth technology, big data analytics, cloud computing technology, optimization algorithm, web-based information technology, and electricity pricing policies. Initial experiment was performed to verify potential benefits of the proposed framework. Particularly, a smart grid infrastructure and sensors were installed in a building to retrieve data. An intelligent machine learning-based prediction model was developed to predict future usage of energy in buildings. The BEEM system can support managers and encourage the end-users to effectively monitor daily and monthly energy usage of buildings.',\n",

Country's demand is rising immensely, especially in domestic sector and it is imperative to decide the new power policies in order to control the situation. One of the primary requirements for power policy design is to construct a detailed electricity demand forecasting model. This study predicts electricity consumption for domestic sector by incorporating economic and demographic activity through Longrange Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAP). The forecasting would be performed up to 2030 when 2005 has been selected as the base year. An extensive data has been collected and structured for the essential factors including growth of enduse appliances, domestic consumption trends and the changes in urban rural ratio. Electrical demand has been predicted under the reference scenario of expected economic growth without any implication of new policies and the results have been compared with official government predictions. Moreover, four different scenarios have also been analyzed to investigate economic and technical aspects of complete electrification with high rate of urbanization, penetration of energy efficient devices, population growth control plan and high economic growth. This research would develop awareness in power system planners and policy makers to congregate the expected increment in demand.\",\n",

This demand from residences has seen consistent growth over the last decade. In developing nations like India, this demand is also a significant contributor to greenhouse emissions, given that we are starting from a lower base compared to other countries. Our understanding in this space though is still limited. One of the key reasons for this is lack of availability of open data sources on household's ownership, usage patterns of appliances and key socio-economic indicators which are critical in gaining insights into demand patterns of households. We outline the methodology for designing and executing a statistically representative survey to collect data to understand and analyze residential electricity demand, presenting the case study of a primary representative survey we conducted in urban Bangalore covering 403 households. We also present the methodology for development of a model to build residential load curves at hourly resolution. We analyze three primary questions; how do households in different income-representative brackets consume electricity, what is the variation in consumption between these brackets and what are key appliance groups that contribute to this variance. We also look at generation profiles from solar PV installations to see what times of the day demand can be met from these renewable sources. In the process, we also examine the rooftop policy in Karnataka and suggest any amendments that can be made to increase adoption of solar rooftop to meet some of this demand locally, based on the analysis of load curves.\",\n",

Current DSM technology can now provide automated off-site control of domestic and industrial devices. Many questions arise in regards to controlling a potentially large proportion of the population's electricity: To what level can we reduce demand? What incentives could retailers offer customers? How do we ensure consumers are satisfied? Previous trials of DSM control techniques have had various levels of success in reducing demand and in changing the consumption habits of individuals over time. The main criticism of existing automated control techniques is that they do not account for customer satisfaction and therefore do not survive in the long term. We propose a novel automated machine learning approach that incorporates customer satisfaction into automated demand reduction, satisfying both customers and retailers. Through a simulation of 200,000 households equipped with automated demand control, we conduct experiments measuring electricity levels alongside population satisfaction levels under different energy control policies. We illustrate that significant energy and cost savings can be achieved without compromising consumer satisfaction.\",\n",

The concept of smart home is extended in two aspects: 1) from traditional households with smart devices, such as advanced metering infrastructure, to intelligent entities with instantaneous and distributive decision-making capabilities; and 2) from individual households to general customer units of possibly large scales. We then develop a hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP) model for a customer real-time decision-making problem. This real-time decision-making framework can effectively be integrated with demand response schemes, which are prediction based and therefore inevitably lead to real-time power-load mismatches. With the Baum-Welch algorithm adopted to learn the nonstationary dynamics of the environment, we propose a value iteration (VI)-based exact solution algorithm for the HM-MDP problem. Unlike conventional VI, the concept of parsimonious sets is used to enable a finite representation of the optimal value function. Instead of iterating the value function in each time step, we iterate the representational parsimonious sets by using the incremental pruning algorithm. Although this exact algorithm leads to optimal policies giving maximum rewards for the smart homes, its complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality. To obtain a low-complexity real-time algorithm that allows adaptively incorporating new observations as the environment changes, we resort to Q-learning-based approximate dynamic programming. Q-learning offers more flexibility in practice because it does not require specific starting and ending points of the scheduling period. Performance analysis of both exact and approximate algorithms, as compared with the other possible alternative decision-making strategies, is presented in simulation results.',\n",

These data were collected from single-family homes (i.e., reference case), single-family homes that owned electric vehicles (EV) and apartments containing multiple families. Cluster analysis was performed to group homes based on their calculated average hourly appliance electricity use, resident building attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics of building residents. Results of regression analysis indicate that variables from all three building types are significantly correlated to appliance electricity consumption. Residents of reference homes and single-family homes with EV tend to spend more time at homes, resulting in higher appliance consumption. Residents that own EVs generally attain a higher education level but do not necessarily having a lower consumption of appliances. Residents with higher income tend to have higher electricity consumption. The results of the analysis can provide new insights and tools for policymakers governing community development and for the utility sector as they seek to deploy new programs to optimize electricity use with existing generation capacity and enhance customer service in response to the growing demand for distributed generation in communities across America.',\n",

The duty cycles are calculated from heat transfer rates using household audit data, thermostat settings and outdoor temperatures. The fit between the load curves estimated from the duty cycle model and load curves calculated from measured data for households where customers set and forget their air conditioner is presented. The air conditioner and heat pump data were gathered during the load control experiments conducted in the summer of 1987 on the Athens Utilities Board distribution system in Athens, Tennessee. Data collected on days when there was no control were used to evaluate the concept of the duty cycle coefficient which was then used to calculate the duty cycle of heat pumps and air conditioners. The theoretical calculations based on the model are compared to actual measured data and are found to be in close agreement.<>',\n",

According to Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) of India, waste generation in Indian urban communities extends between 200 - 870 grams per day, contingent on the localities' standard of living and the area of the city. Therefore, in this paper we propose a concept that focuses on a sustainable solution using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms for waste and carbon footprint reduction in a home.

This demand from residences has seen consistent growth over the last decade. In developing nations like India, this demand is also a significant contributor to greenhouse emissions, given that we are starting from a lower base compared to other countries. Our understanding in this space though is still limited. One of the key reasons for this is lack of availability of open data sources on household's ownership, usage patterns of appliances and key socio-economic indicators which are critical in gaining insights into demand patterns of households. We outline the methodology for designing and executing a statistically representative survey to collect data to understand and analyze residential electricity demand, presenting the case study of a primary representative survey we conducted in urban Bangalore covering 403 households. We also present the methodology for development of a model to build residential load curves at hourly resolution. We analyze three primary questions; how do households in different income-representative brackets consume electricity, what is the variation in consumption between these brackets and what are key appliance groups that contribute to this variance. We also look at generation profiles from solar PV installations to see what times of the day demand can be met from these renewable sources. In the process, we also examine the rooftop policy in Karnataka and suggest any amendments that can be made to increase adoption of solar rooftop to meet some of this demand locally, based on the analysis of load curves.\",\n",

Specifically, the research develops the evaluation model for Slovenian neighborhood, based on the modular system of indicators and to it connected methodology for the interpretation of resulting values. The envisioned instrument evaluates sustainability performance through five crucial categories: energy efficiency, environmental efficiency, efficient organization and management of the built environment, communities' engagement level, and exploitation of ICT smart solutions to foster other four categories of efficiency. Each of the category is observed from the aspect of three strategic levels of implementation: (1) buildings or households, (2) public and in-between spaces, (3) traffic organization and infrastructure. Such structuring introduces possibilities for evaluating neighborhoods from environmental aspects, built environment characteristics, appearances and functionalities, as well as activities, habits and socio-demographic structure of their inhabitants - all being crucial factors in achieving better performance and efficiency of cities and their parts.\",\n",

This study assesses the life cycle costs and energy efficiency impacts of harnessing solar energy for use in residential buildings. The paper draws upon and further develops other research done in the field by analyzing energy savings and impacts of BIPV in different demographic and geographical settings for a representative building model type in an urban setting.

Minor shifts in peak demand have major implications in terms of savings for both consumers and utilities. This study develops a cloud computing-based big data analytics framework for a building energy efficiency monitoring (BEEM) system that enables managers to facilitate efficient energy use in multiple residential buildings. The framework incorporates smart meter technology, remote sensing and monitoring, Bluetooth technology, big data analytics, cloud computing technology, optimization algorithm, web-based information technology, and electricity pricing policies. Initial experiment was performed to verify potential benefits of the proposed framework. Particularly, a smart grid infrastructure and sensors were installed in a building to retrieve data. An intelligent machine learning-based prediction model was developed to predict future usage of energy in buildings. The BEEM system can support managers and encourage the end-users to effectively monitor daily and monthly energy usage of buildings.',\n",

This study views the adoption of PEVs as one pathway towards more sustainable transportation and lower Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and explores demographic factors that can be attributed to household-level PEV adoption. An aim of this study is to estimate nationwide adoption patterns in the U.S. and explore public sector strategies and innovation policies to accelerate PEV adoption. Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis is applied to the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) dataset. The model explored a broad set of variables including electricity consumption choices, participation in energy-efficiency programs, and demographic characteristics to explore the relationships between PEV adoption and potentially influential factors. Findings indicated that PEV adoption is correlated with a household's income level, the use of home solar technology, and the electricity consumption from backup generator. A better understanding of individual adopter characteristics that are correlated with PEV adoption can inform policy for optimizing feasible strategies to accelerate PEV adoption in the U.S.\",\n",

In this paper we outline the on-going research that seeks for a reliable metrics to evaluate the characteristics of built environments in terms of its efficiency and performance on the level of neighborhoods. Specifically, the research develops the evaluation model for Slovenian neighborhood, based on the modular system of indicators and to it connected methodology for the interpretation of resulting values. The envisioned instrument evaluates sustainability performance through five crucial categories: energy efficiency, environmental efficiency, efficient organization and management of the built environment, communities' engagement level, and exploitation of ICT smart solutions to foster other four categories of efficiency. Each of the category is observed from the aspect of three strategic levels of implementation: (1) buildings or households, (2) public and in-between spaces, (3) traffic organization and infrastructure. Such structuring introduces possibilities for evaluating neighborhoods from environmental aspects, built environment characteristics, appearances and functionalities, as well as activities, habits and socio-demographic structure of their inhabitants - all being crucial factors in achieving better performance and efficiency of cities and their parts.\",\n",

However, only 1,787 measures were installed in the first year and some argue that the programme would cause financial risk to the households as the \"golden rule\" of the policy not always true even cost-benefit analysis was conducted before the launch of GD and assessments were conducted when joining the programme. It is observed that due to \"rebound effect\" and other uncertainties in the modelling, the traditional cost-benefit analysis may not be accurate. Therefore, this paper tries to review official the investment performance model provided by taking rebound effect into account. It is found that before rebound effect was applied, 14% of the sample measures were not able to repay the investment, while the rebound effect would further extend the repayment period for the energy saving measures, 13%, 70% and 23.3% for \"lighting\", \"building fabric\" and \"heating and cooling\" cannot be repaid in 20 years after installation. The prospect theory is also applied to explain why the households were reluctant to invest while the possibility of earning money is still high.',\n",

Country's demand is rising immensely, especially in domestic sector and it is imperative to decide the new power policies in order to control the situation. One of the primary requirements for power policy design is to construct a detailed electricity demand forecasting model. This study predicts electricity consumption for domestic sector by incorporating economic and demographic activity through Longrange Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAP). The forecasting would be performed up to 2030 when 2005 has been selected as the base year. An extensive data has been collected and structured for the essential factors including growth of enduse appliances, domestic consumption trends and the changes in urban rural ratio. Electrical demand has been predicted under the reference scenario of expected economic growth without any implication of new policies and the results have been compared with official government predictions. Moreover, four different scenarios have also been analyzed to investigate economic and technical aspects of complete electrification with high rate of urbanization, penetration of energy efficient devices, population growth control plan and high economic growth. This research would develop awareness in power system planners and policy makers to congregate the expected increment in demand.\",\n",

This study views the adoption of PEVs as one pathway towards more sustainable transportation and lower Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and explores demographic factors that can be attributed to household-level PEV adoption. An aim of this study is to estimate nationwide adoption patterns in the U.S. and explore public sector strategies and innovation policies to accelerate PEV adoption. Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis is applied to the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) dataset. The model explored a broad set of variables including electricity consumption choices, participation in energy-efficiency programs, and demographic characteristics to explore the relationships between PEV adoption and potentially influential factors. Findings indicated that PEV adoption is correlated with a household's income level, the use of home solar technology, and the electricity consumption from backup generator. A better understanding of individual adopter characteristics that are correlated with PEV adoption can inform policy for optimizing feasible strategies to accelerate PEV adoption in the U.S.\",\n",

We identify the elements of apartment buildings which are related to electricity and water use and demonstrate energy consumption forecast based on the proposed model. To verify the patterns of electricity energy and water consumption in relation with apartment buildings, we collect data for one of the apartment complexes in South Korea. Both weather history data including temperature and relative humidity and building information such as floor number and the gross area of apartment units are selected as Building-Information Factors (BIF) to analyze their effects on energy use in apartment buildings. In this paper, we cover annual electricity energy and water consumption among major household utilities that is manipulated by BIF. We conduct Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) and use neural network-based model such as Multiple-Layer Perceptron (MLP) not only to reveal the relation among the elements such as weather information and BIF toward energy and water consumption model but also to estimate electricity energy and water use forecast. By carrying out this research, the relationship among BIF and energy consumption data sets is turned out to be essential information for establishing a Korean Style Apartment Management Information System as well as establishing a real estate policy on housing prices according to the diversification in floor numbers and gross areas of apartment units.',\n",

Previous work has explored the use of photovoltaics in specific residential sites in rural areas for providing the electricity needs of the residential complex [1]. However, the opportunity of employing building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and energy efficient building designs for meeting the energy needs of representative residential buildings in urban areas has not been previously investigated. This paper provides a study of the use of BIPV methods for residential sector retrofit in three major urban cities in Egypt. This study assesses the life cycle costs and energy efficiency impacts of harnessing solar energy for use in residential buildings. The paper draws upon and further develops other research done in the field by analyzing energy savings and impacts of BIPV in different demographic and geographical settings for a representative building model type in an urban setting. Two benchmark building performance simulation models were used that reflect the average energy consumption characteristics of air-conditioned residential apartments in Cairo, Alexandria, and Asyut [2]. This study provides a background of the current Egyptian energy sector and a complete design of a photovoltaic system in the three geographical regions. It also discusses the challenges facing solar energy use in Egypt and possible methods to finance investment in the solar technology on a community scale. Government policy recommendations are proposed to promote the integration of renewable energy technology in the residential sector.',\n",

Utilizing energy efficient air conditioner is crucial to save electricity and thus reduce consumer bills. This work presents the total electricity and cost savings gained from the adoption of energy efficient air conditioners, in compliance with Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). Based on our data analysis, an inverter type air conditioners consumes 33% less electricity on average than the non-inverter type air conditioners. Meanwhile, the potential life cycle cost savings by adopting a 5-star inverter type air conditioner as opposed to 2-star non-inverter type is significantly huge amounted to RM 3,907. In conclusion, choosing highly energy efficient air conditioners is a smart decision to accrue greater savings over time.',\n",

However, only 1,787 measures were installed in the first year and some argue that the programme would cause financial risk to the households as the \"golden rule\" of the policy not always true even cost-benefit analysis was conducted before the launch of GD and assessments were conducted when joining the programme. It is observed that due to \"rebound effect\" and other uncertainties in the modelling, the traditional cost-benefit analysis may not be accurate. Therefore, this paper tries to review official the investment performance model provided by taking rebound effect into account. It is found that before rebound effect was applied, 14% of the sample measures were not able to repay the investment, while the rebound effect would further extend the repayment period for the energy saving measures, 13%, 70% and 23.3% for \"lighting\", \"building fabric\" and \"heating and cooling\" cannot be repaid in 20 years after installation. The prospect theory is also applied to explain why the households were reluctant to invest while the possibility of earning money is still high.',\n",

These data were collected from single-family homes (i.e., reference case), single-family homes that owned electric vehicles (EV) and apartments containing multiple families. Cluster analysis was performed to group homes based on their calculated average hourly appliance electricity use, resident building attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics of building residents. Results of regression analysis indicate that variables from all three building types are significantly correlated to appliance electricity consumption. Residents of reference homes and single-family homes with EV tend to spend more time at homes, resulting in higher appliance consumption. Residents that own EVs generally attain a higher education level but do not necessarily having a lower consumption of appliances. Residents with higher income tend to have higher electricity consumption. The results of the analysis can provide new insights and tools for policymakers governing community development and for the utility sector as they seek to deploy new programs to optimize electricity use with existing generation capacity and enhance customer service in response to the growing demand for distributed generation in communities across America.',\n",

This study views the adoption of PEVs as one pathway towards more sustainable transportation and lower Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and explores demographic factors that can be attributed to household-level PEV adoption. An aim of this study is to estimate nationwide adoption patterns in the U.S. and explore public sector strategies and innovation policies to accelerate PEV adoption. Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis is applied to the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) dataset. The model explored a broad set of variables including electricity consumption choices, participation in energy-efficiency programs, and demographic characteristics to explore the relationships between PEV adoption and potentially influential factors. Findings indicated that PEV adoption is correlated with a household's income level, the use of home solar technology, and the electricity consumption from backup generator. A better understanding of individual adopter characteristics that are correlated with PEV adoption can inform policy for optimizing feasible strategies to accelerate PEV adoption in the U.S.\",\n",

In this paper we outline the on-going research that seeks for a reliable metrics to evaluate the characteristics of built environments in terms of its efficiency and performance on the level of neighborhoods. Specifically, the research develops the evaluation model for Slovenian neighborhood, based on the modular system of indicators and to it connected methodology for the interpretation of resulting values. The envisioned instrument evaluates sustainability performance through five crucial categories: energy efficiency, environmental efficiency, efficient organization and management of the built environment, communities' engagement level, and exploitation of ICT smart solutions to foster other four categories of efficiency. Each of the category is observed from the aspect of three strategic levels of implementation: (1) buildings or households, (2) public and in-between spaces, (3) traffic organization and infrastructure. Such structuring introduces possibilities for evaluating neighborhoods from environmental aspects, built environment characteristics, appearances and functionalities, as well as activities, habits and socio-demographic structure of their inhabitants - all being crucial factors in achieving better performance and efficiency of cities and their parts.\",\n",

Previous work has explored the use of photovoltaics in specific residential sites in rural areas for providing the electricity needs of the residential complex [1]. However, the opportunity of employing building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and energy efficient building designs for meeting the energy needs of representative residential buildings in urban areas has not been previously investigated. This paper provides a study of the use of BIPV methods for residential sector retrofit in three major urban cities in Egypt. This study assesses the life cycle costs and energy efficiency impacts of harnessing solar energy for use in residential buildings. The paper draws upon and further develops other research done in the field by analyzing energy savings and impacts of BIPV in different demographic and geographical settings for a representative building model type in an urban setting. Two benchmark building performance simulation models were used that reflect the average energy consumption characteristics of air-conditioned residential apartments in Cairo, Alexandria, and Asyut [2]. This study provides a background of the current Egyptian energy sector and a complete design of a photovoltaic system in the three geographical regions. It also discusses the challenges facing solar energy use in Egypt and possible methods to finance investment in the solar technology on a community scale. Government policy recommendations are proposed to promote the integration of renewable energy technology in the residential sector.',\n",

The simplicity of this technique has made it very popular in several domains. However, the use of this type of approach to support decisions in the power and energy domain is still rather unexplored, especially regarding the flexibility of consumption in buildings in response to recent environmental concerns and consequent governmental policies that envisage the increase of energy efficiency. In order to determine the amount of consumption reduction that should be applied in a building, this article proposes a methodology that adapts the past results of similar cases in order to achieve a decision for the new case. A clustering methodology is used to identify the most similar previous cases, and an expert system is developed to refine the final solution after the combination of the similar cases results. The proposed CBR methodology is evaluated using a set of real data from a residential building. Results prove the advantages of the proposed methodology, demonstrating its applicability to enhance house energy management systems by determining the amount of reduction that should be applied in each moment, thus allowing such systems to carry out the reduction through the different loads of the building.',\n",

Minor shifts in peak demand have major implications in terms of savings for both consumers and utilities. This study develops a cloud computing-based big data analytics framework for a building energy efficiency monitoring (BEEM) system that enables managers to facilitate efficient energy use in multiple residential buildings. The framework incorporates smart meter technology, remote sensing and monitoring, Bluetooth technology, big data analytics, cloud computing technology, optimization algorithm, web-based information technology, and electricity pricing policies. Initial experiment was performed to verify potential benefits of the proposed framework. Particularly, a smart grid infrastructure and sensors were installed in a building to retrieve data. An intelligent machine learning-based prediction model was developed to predict future usage of energy in buildings. The BEEM system can support managers and encourage the end-users to effectively monitor daily and monthly energy usage of buildings.',\n",

This study views the adoption of PEVs as one pathway towards more sustainable transportation and lower Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and explores demographic factors that can be attributed to household-level PEV adoption. An aim of this study is to estimate nationwide adoption patterns in the U.S. and explore public sector strategies and innovation policies to accelerate PEV adoption. Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis is applied to the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) dataset. The model explored a broad set of variables including electricity consumption choices, participation in energy-efficiency programs, and demographic characteristics to explore the relationships between PEV adoption and potentially influential factors. Findings indicated that PEV adoption is correlated with a household's income level, the use of home solar technology, and the electricity consumption from backup generator. A better understanding of individual adopter characteristics that are correlated with PEV adoption can inform policy for optimizing feasible strategies to accelerate PEV adoption in the U.S.\",\n",

In this paper we outline the on-going research that seeks for a reliable metrics to evaluate the characteristics of built environments in terms of its efficiency and performance on the level of neighborhoods. Specifically, the research develops the evaluation model for Slovenian neighborhood, based on the modular system of indicators and to it connected methodology for the interpretation of resulting values. The envisioned instrument evaluates sustainability performance through five crucial categories: energy efficiency, environmental efficiency, efficient organization and management of the built environment, communities' engagement level, and exploitation of ICT smart solutions to foster other four categories of efficiency. Each of the category is observed from the aspect of three strategic levels of implementation: (1) buildings or households, (2) public and in-between spaces, (3) traffic organization and infrastructure. Such structuring introduces possibilities for evaluating neighborhoods from environmental aspects, built environment characteristics, appearances and functionalities, as well as activities, habits and socio-demographic structure of their inhabitants - all being crucial factors in achieving better performance and efficiency of cities and their parts.\",\n",

The simplicity of this technique has made it very popular in several domains. However, the use of this type of approach to support decisions in the power and energy domain is still rather unexplored, especially regarding the flexibility of consumption in buildings in response to recent environmental concerns and consequent governmental policies that envisage the increase of energy efficiency. In order to determine the amount of consumption reduction that should be applied in a building, this article proposes a methodology that adapts the past results of similar cases in order to achieve a decision for the new case. A clustering methodology is used to identify the most similar previous cases, and an expert system is developed to refine the final solution after the combination of the similar cases results. The proposed CBR methodology is evaluated using a set of real data from a residential building. Results prove the advantages of the proposed methodology, demonstrating its applicability to enhance house energy management systems by determining the amount of reduction that should be applied in each moment, thus allowing such systems to carry out the reduction through the different loads of the building.',\n",

Utilizing energy efficient air conditioner is crucial to save electricity and thus reduce consumer bills. This work presents the total electricity and cost savings gained from the adoption of energy efficient air conditioners, in compliance with Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). Based on our data analysis, an inverter type air conditioners consumes 33% less electricity on average than the non-inverter type air conditioners. Meanwhile, the potential life cycle cost savings by adopting a 5-star inverter type air conditioner as opposed to 2-star non-inverter type is significantly huge amounted to RM 3,907. In conclusion, choosing highly energy efficient air conditioners is a smart decision to accrue greater savings over time.',\n",

However, only 1,787 measures were installed in the first year and some argue that the programme would cause financial risk to the households as the \"golden rule\" of the policy not always true even cost-benefit analysis was conducted before the launch of GD and assessments were conducted when joining the programme. It is observed that due to \"rebound effect\" and other uncertainties in the modelling, the traditional cost-benefit analysis may not be accurate. Therefore, this paper tries to review official the investment performance model provided by taking rebound effect into account. It is found that before rebound effect was applied, 14% of the sample measures were not able to repay the investment, while the rebound effect would further extend the repayment period for the energy saving measures, 13%, 70% and 23.3% for \"lighting\", \"building fabric\" and \"heating and cooling\" cannot be repaid in 20 years after installation. The prospect theory is also applied to explain why the households were reluctant to invest while the possibility of earning money is still high.',\n",

Country's demand is rising immensely, especially in domestic sector and it is imperative to decide the new power policies in order to control the situation. One of the primary requirements for power policy design is to construct a detailed electricity demand forecasting model. This study predicts electricity consumption for domestic sector by incorporating economic and demographic activity through Longrange Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAP). The forecasting would be performed up to 2030 when 2005 has been selected as the base year. An extensive data has been collected and structured for the essential factors including growth of enduse appliances, domestic consumption trends and the changes in urban rural ratio. Electrical demand has been predicted under the reference scenario of expected economic growth without any implication of new policies and the results have been compared with official government predictions. Moreover, four different scenarios have also been analyzed to investigate economic and technical aspects of complete electrification with high rate of urbanization, penetration of energy efficient devices, population growth control plan and high economic growth. This research would develop awareness in power system planners and policy makers to congregate the expected increment in demand.\",\n",

This study views the adoption of PEVs as one pathway towards more sustainable transportation and lower Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and explores demographic factors that can be attributed to household-level PEV adoption. An aim of this study is to estimate nationwide adoption patterns in the U.S. and explore public sector strategies and innovation policies to accelerate PEV adoption. Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis is applied to the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) dataset. The model explored a broad set of variables including electricity consumption choices, participation in energy-efficiency programs, and demographic characteristics to explore the relationships between PEV adoption and potentially influential factors. Findings indicated that PEV adoption is correlated with a household's income level, the use of home solar technology, and the electricity consumption from backup generator. A better understanding of individual adopter characteristics that are correlated with PEV adoption can inform policy for optimizing feasible strategies to accelerate PEV adoption in the U.S.\",\n",

These data were collected from single-family homes (i.e., reference case), single-family homes that owned electric vehicles (EV) and apartments containing multiple families. Cluster analysis was performed to group homes based on their calculated average hourly appliance electricity use, resident building attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics of building residents. Results of regression analysis indicate that variables from all three building types are significantly correlated to appliance electricity consumption. Residents of reference homes and single-family homes with EV tend to spend more time at homes, resulting in higher appliance consumption. Residents that own EVs generally attain a higher education level but do not necessarily having a lower consumption of appliances. Residents with higher income tend to have higher electricity consumption. The results of the analysis can provide new insights and tools for policymakers governing community development and for the utility sector as they seek to deploy new programs to optimize electricity use with existing generation capacity and enhance customer service in response to the growing demand for distributed generation in communities across America.',\n",

Country's demand is rising immensely, especially in domestic sector and it is imperative to decide the new power policies in order to control the situation. One of the primary requirements for power policy design is to construct a detailed electricity demand forecasting model. This study predicts electricity consumption for domestic sector by incorporating economic and demographic activity through Longrange Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAP). The forecasting would be performed up to 2030 when 2005 has been selected as the base year. An extensive data has been collected and structured for the essential factors including growth of enduse appliances, domestic consumption trends and the changes in urban rural ratio. Electrical demand has been predicted under the reference scenario of expected economic growth without any implication of new policies and the results have been compared with official government predictions. Moreover, four different scenarios have also been analyzed to investigate economic and technical aspects of complete electrification with high rate of urbanization, penetration of energy efficient devices, population growth control plan and high economic growth. This research would develop awareness in power system planners and policy makers to congregate the expected increment in demand.\",\n",

These data were collected from single-family homes (i.e., reference case), single-family homes that owned electric vehicles (EV) and apartments containing multiple families. Cluster analysis was performed to group homes based on their calculated average hourly appliance electricity use, resident building attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics of building residents. Results of regression analysis indicate that variables from all three building types are significantly correlated to appliance electricity consumption. Residents of reference homes and single-family homes with EV tend to spend more time at homes, resulting in higher appliance consumption. Residents that own EVs generally attain a higher education level but do not necessarily having a lower consumption of appliances. Residents with higher income tend to have higher electricity consumption. The results of the analysis can provide new insights and tools for policymakers governing community development and for the utility sector as they seek to deploy new programs to optimize electricity use with existing generation capacity and enhance customer service in response to the growing demand for distributed generation in communities across America.',\n",

This demand from residences has seen consistent growth over the last decade. In developing nations like India, this demand is also a significant contributor to greenhouse emissions, given that we are starting from a lower base compared to other countries. Our understanding in this space though is still limited. One of the key reasons for this is lack of availability of open data sources on household's ownership, usage patterns of appliances and key socio-economic indicators which are critical in gaining insights into demand patterns of households. We outline the methodology for designing and executing a statistically representative survey to collect data to understand and analyze residential electricity demand, presenting the case study of a primary representative survey we conducted in urban Bangalore covering 403 households. We also present the methodology for development of a model to build residential load curves at hourly resolution. We analyze three primary questions; how do households in different income-representative brackets consume electricity, what is the variation in consumption between these brackets and what are key appliance groups that contribute to this variance. We also look at generation profiles from solar PV installations to see what times of the day demand can be met from these renewable sources. In the process, we also examine the rooftop policy in Karnataka and suggest any amendments that can be made to increase adoption of solar rooftop to meet some of this demand locally, based on the analysis of load curves.\",\n",

Current DSM technology can now provide automated off-site control of domestic and industrial devices. Many questions arise in regards to controlling a potentially large proportion of the population's electricity: To what level can we reduce demand? What incentives could retailers offer customers? How do we ensure consumers are satisfied? Previous trials of DSM control techniques have had various levels of success in reducing demand and in changing the consumption habits of individuals over time. The main criticism of existing automated control techniques is that they do not account for customer satisfaction and therefore do not survive in the long term. We propose a novel automated machine learning approach that incorporates customer satisfaction into automated demand reduction, satisfying both customers and retailers. Through a simulation of 200,000 households equipped with automated demand control, we conduct experiments measuring electricity levels alongside population satisfaction levels under different energy control policies. We illustrate that significant energy and cost savings can be achieved without compromising consumer satisfaction.\",\n",

Based on our data analysis, an inverter type air conditioners consumes 33% less electricity on average than the non-inverter type air conditioners. Meanwhile, the potential life cycle cost savings by adopting a 5-star inverter type air conditioner as opposed to 2-star non-inverter type is significantly huge amounted to RM 3,907.

The concept of smart home is extended in two aspects: 1) from traditional households with smart devices, such as advanced metering infrastructure, to intelligent entities with instantaneous and distributive decision-making capabilities; and 2) from individual households to general customer units of possibly large scales. We then develop a hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP) model for a customer real-time decision-making problem. This real-time decision-making framework can effectively be integrated with demand response schemes, which are prediction based and therefore inevitably lead to real-time power-load mismatches. With the Baum-Welch algorithm adopted to learn the nonstationary dynamics of the environment, we propose a value iteration (VI)-based exact solution algorithm for the HM-MDP problem. Unlike conventional VI, the concept of parsimonious sets is used to enable a finite representation of the optimal value function. Instead of iterating the value function in each time step, we iterate the representational parsimonious sets by using the incremental pruning algorithm. Although this exact algorithm leads to optimal policies giving maximum rewards for the smart homes, its complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality. To obtain a low-complexity real-time algorithm that allows adaptively incorporating new observations as the environment changes, we resort to Q-learning-based approximate dynamic programming. Q-learning offers more flexibility in practice because it does not require specific starting and ending points of the scheduling period. Performance analysis of both exact and approximate algorithms, as compared with the other possible alternative decision-making strategies, is presented in simulation results.',\n",

These data were collected from single-family homes (i.e., reference case), single-family homes that owned electric vehicles (EV) and apartments containing multiple families. Cluster analysis was performed to group homes based on their calculated average hourly appliance electricity use, resident building attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics of building residents. Results of regression analysis indicate that variables from all three building types are significantly correlated to appliance electricity consumption. Residents of reference homes and single-family homes with EV tend to spend more time at homes, resulting in higher appliance consumption. Residents that own EVs generally attain a higher education level but do not necessarily having a lower consumption of appliances. Residents with higher income tend to have higher electricity consumption. The results of the analysis can provide new insights and tools for policymakers governing community development and for the utility sector as they seek to deploy new programs to optimize electricity use with existing generation capacity and enhance customer service in response to the growing demand for distributed generation in communities across America.',\n",

The duty cycles are calculated from heat transfer rates using household audit data, thermostat settings and outdoor temperatures. The fit between the load curves estimated from the duty cycle model and load curves calculated from measured data for households where customers set and forget their air conditioner is presented. The air conditioner and heat pump data were gathered during the load control experiments conducted in the summer of 1987 on the Athens Utilities Board distribution system in Athens, Tennessee. Data collected on days when there was no control were used to evaluate the concept of the duty cycle coefficient which was then used to calculate the duty cycle of heat pumps and air conditioners. The theoretical calculations based on the model are compared to actual measured data and are found to be in close agreement.<>',\n",

In that, as per Centre for Policy Research (CPR), about 25% of the total production is diverted to meet the daily consumption in an Indian household. Not only this but also, waste management has become an important issue to deal with. According to Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) of India, waste generation in Indian urban communities extends between 200 - 870 grams per day, contingent on the localities' standard of living and the area of the city. Therefore, in this paper we propose a concept that focuses on a sustainable solution using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms for waste and carbon footprint reduction in a home. This concept explains a solution availed with the help of a proposed model called Home Resource Management (HoReM) that is imbibed in a Smart home.\",\n",

This demand from residences has seen consistent growth over the last decade. In developing nations like India, this demand is also a significant contributor to greenhouse emissions, given that we are starting from a lower base compared to other countries. Our understanding in this space though is still limited. One of the key reasons for this is lack of availability of open data sources on household's ownership, usage patterns of appliances and key socio-economic indicators which are critical in gaining insights into demand patterns of households. We outline the methodology for designing and executing a statistically representative survey to collect data to understand and analyze residential electricity demand, presenting the case study of a primary representative survey we conducted in urban Bangalore covering 403 households. We also present the methodology for development of a model to build residential load curves at hourly resolution. We analyze three primary questions; how do households in different income-representative brackets consume electricity, what is the variation in consumption between these brackets and what are key appliance groups that contribute to this variance. We also look at generation profiles from solar PV installations to see what times of the day demand can be met from these renewable sources. In the process, we also examine the rooftop policy in Karnataka and suggest any amendments that can be made to increase adoption of solar rooftop to meet some of this demand locally, based on the analysis of load curves.\",\n",

We present an overview of some of the challenges and some of the solutions we have for sustainable lean and green engineering in product, process, and service systems in various industries. We will provide examples of products, processes, and service systems in manufacturing, design, electronic, automotive, and construction. We will discuss the fundamentals of alternative energy sources and the carbon footprint in a variety of different industries with examples from all around the world. We also will define the basic terms of green engineering and sustainability. We will introduce the basic rules on how to design and produce for green. You will gain an understanding of the core challenges we are facing in terms of sustainability, global warming, the carbon footprint, and toxic products. We will examine the complexity of sustainable green engineering while recognizing that it\\'s a complicated and complex system mainly because we don\\'t really understand the mechanisms that drive it. In Part 2 we focus in particular on waste reduction. This includes becoming leaner on an international basis by performing environmental engineering and industrial ecology, and by understanding how the Internet can help our greening efforts. We also review the concept of green telecom and green data centers, and others that can help to green the entire world.\",\"article_number\":\"EDP151\",\"abstract_url\":\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/courses/details/EDP151\",\"publication_title\":\"An Introduction to Sustainable Green Engineering Part 2\",\"publication_year\":2010,\"publication_date\":\"03/04/2010\",\"citing_paper_count\":0,\"citing_patent_count\":0,\"index_terms\":{\"ieee_terms\":{\"terms\":[\"Green products\",\"Environmental economics\",\"Social implications of technology\",\"Energy resources\",\"Green design\",\"Ecology\",\"Greenhouse effect\",\"Sustainable development\",\"Tutorials\",\"Ecodesign\",\"Global warming\",\"Environmental factors\",\"Environmental monitoring\",\"Energy management\",\"Environmental engineering\"]},\"author_terms\":{\"terms\":[\"green energy\"]}}},{\"doi\":\"10.1109/EEEIC.2013.6549556\",\"title\":\"GA strategies for optimal planning of daily energy consumptions and user satisfaction in buildings\",\"publisher\":\"IEEE\",\"partnum\":\"13EX7569\",\"rank\":2,\"authors\":{\"authors\":[{\"affiliation\":\"Electronic Department, University of Roma TRE, Rome, Italy\",\"authorUrl\":\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017123100\",\"id\":38017123100,\"full_name\":\"E.

To deal with this problem without installing additional generation capacity, resulting in a loss of efficiency and increased greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to design a system for the optimal planning of electricity consumption in the residential sector. Since the energy use in buildings is closely related to the activities of residents, the shaping of the load curve and the smoothing of the energy peak must not be done without compromising the user comfort. This paper investigates the use of an heuristic strategies to find the optimal planning of energy consumption inside every building in a neighborhood. The issue is formulated as multi-objective optimization problem aiming at reducing the peak load as well as minimizing the energy cost and the impact on the user satisfaction. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed by simulation results carried out on a residential area with a variety of electrical devices. The simulations reveal that the proposed strategy is able to plan the daily energy consumptions of a great number of electrical devices with good performance in terms of computational cost.\",\"article_number\":\"6549556\",\"pdf_url\":\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6549556\",\"html_url\":\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6549556/\",\"abstract_url\":\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6549556/\",\"publication_title\":\"2013 12th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering\",\"conference_location\":\"Wroclaw\",\"conference_dates\":\"5-8 May 2013\",\"publication_number\":6542219,\"is_number\":6549523,\"publication_year\":2013,\"publication_date\":\"5-8 May 2013\",\"start_page\":\"440\",\"end_page\":\"444\",\"citing_paper_count\":6,\"citing_patent_count\":0,\"index_terms\":{\"ieee_terms\":{\"terms\":[\"Genetic algorithms\",\"Planning\",\"Electricity\",\"Energy consumption\",\"Optimization\",\"Sociology\",\"Statistics\"]},\"author_terms\":{\"terms\":[\"demand side management\",\"energy conpsuntion scheduling\",\"multiobjective optimizzation\",\"evolutionary algorithm\"]}}},{\"title\":\"Introduction to Sustainable Green Engineering System Analysis & Design\",\"publisher\":\"IEEE\",\"rank\":3,\"authors\":{\"authors\":[{\"full_name\":\"Paul Ranky\",\"author_order\":1}]},\"access_type\":\"LOCKED\",\"content_type\":\"Courses\",\"abstract\":\"During this analytical green engineering methods series we are going to review green engineering system and process modeling, system analysis and design following sustainable lean six sigma principles.
